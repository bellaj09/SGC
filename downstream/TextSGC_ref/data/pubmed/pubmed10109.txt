Ventilation images can be derived from four-dimensional computed tomography 4DCT by analyzing the change in HU values and deformable vector fields between different respiration phases of computed tomography CT. As deformable image registration DIR is involved accuracy of 4DCT-derived ventilation image is sensitive to the choice of DIR algorithms. To overcome the uncertainty associated with DIR we develop a method based on deep convolutional neural network CNN to derive ventilation images directly from the 4DCT without explicit image registration.
