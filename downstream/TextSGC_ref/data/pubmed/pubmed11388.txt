The transverse field profile of light has been recognized as a resource for classical and quantum communications for which reliable methods of sorting or demultiplexing spatial optical modes are required. Here we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art mode demultiplexing of Laguerre-Gaussian beams according to both their orbital angular momentum and radial topological numbers using a flow of two concatenated deep neural networks. The first network serves as a transfer function from experimentally generated to ideal numerically generated data while using a unique "histogram weighted loss" function that solves the problem of images with limited significant information. The second network acts as a spatial-modes classifier. Our method uses only the intensity profile of modes or their superposition making the phase information redundant.
