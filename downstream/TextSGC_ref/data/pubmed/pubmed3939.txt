"Complex physiological and behavioral traits including neurological and psychiatric disorders often associate with distributed anatomical variation. This paper introduces a global metric called morphometricity as a measure of the anatomical signature of different traits. Morphometricity is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by macroscopic brain morphology. We estimate morphometricity via a linear mixed-effects model that uses an anatomical similarity matrix computed based on measurements derived from structural brain MRI scans. We examined over 3800 unique MRI scans from nine large-scale studies to estimate the morphometricity of a range of phenotypes including clinical diagnoses such as Alzheimers disease and nonclinical traits such as measures of cognition. Our results demonstrate that morphometricity can provide novel insights about the neuroanatomical correlates of a diverse set of traits revealing associations that might not be detectable through traditional statistical techniques."
