Infant regulatory problems RPs i.e. problems with crying feeding and/or sleeping are associated with behavioral and emotional problems in childhood. It is unclear however whether these behavioral and emotional problems persist into adulthood. The default mode network DMN and salience network SN support both interoceptive regulation and social and emotional abilities. We thus hypothesized that adults who had experienced RPs in infancy have more behavioral and emotional problems which are mediated by DMN and/or SN alterations. The Default Mode Network Mediates the Impact of Infant Regulatory Problems on Adult Avoidant Personality Traits.
