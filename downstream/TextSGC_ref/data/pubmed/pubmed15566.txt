Online role-play has the potential to actively engage students in authentic learning experiences and help develop their clinical reasoning skills. However evaluation of student learning for this kind of simulation focuses mainly on the content and outcome of learning rather than on the process of learning through student engagement. This article reports on the use of a student engagement framework to evaluate an online role-play offered as part of a course in Bachelor of Nursing and Bachelor of Midwifery programs. Instruments that measure student engagement to date have targeted large numbers of students at program and institutional levels rather than at the level of a specific learning activity. Although the framework produced some useful findings for evaluation purposes further refinement of the questions is required to be certain that deep learning results from the engagement that occurs with course-level learning initiatives. An innovative strategy in evaluation: using a student engagement framework to evaluate a role-based simulation.
