The use of three-dimensional virtual reality technologies in education has been widely reported in the literature. The goal of this article is to review how the virtual environment for radiotherapy training VERT can be utilised to support the teaching of intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT volumetric-modulated arc therapy and dynamic conformal arc therapy techniques. Utilising Pinnacle v14 Philips Radiation Oncology Systems Madison WI and Monaco v 5.10 Elekta CMS Maryland Heights MO we exported IMRT volumetric-modulated arc therapy and dynamic conformal arc therapy treatment plans to VERT. Quality assurance QA plans were also exported from the Monaco planning software to demonstrate theoretical concepts and virtual plan delivery using the ArcCHECK phantom Sun Nuclear Corp Melbourne FL and solid water IMRT phantom. Several VERT features were utilised to critically evaluate dose coverage and organ at risk sparing on inverse treatment plans. The display of gantry and multileaf collimator motion and fluence maps could be a useful feature in the education of treatment planning concepts. QA could be delivered on VERT to demonstrate patient-specific QA concepts in a virtual environment. Anecdotal evidence shows that the use of VERT for collaborative plan evaluation sessions is likely to engage the students and improve their ability to evaluate treatment plans. VERT can be utilised to reinforce understanding of treatment plan evaluation skills QA and treatment delivery of inverse plans in educational environments.
