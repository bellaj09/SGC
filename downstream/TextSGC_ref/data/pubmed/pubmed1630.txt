The response in the United States to the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for the infection. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab NPS specimens limitations in personal protective equipment PPE for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses.
