Biogenic compounds are important materials for drug discovery and chemical biology. In this work we report a quasi-biogenic molecule generator QBMG to compose virtual quasi-biogenic compound libraries by means of gated recurrent unit recurrent neural networks. The library includes stereo-chemical properties which are crucial features of natural products. QMBG can reproduce the property distribution of the underlying training set while being able to generate realistic novel molecules outside of the training set. Furthermore these compounds are associated with known bioactivities. A focused compound library based on a given chemotype/scaffold can also be generated by this approach combining transfer learning technology. This approach can be used to generate virtual compound libraries for pharmaceutical lead identification and optimization. QBMG: quasi-biogenic molecule generator with deep recurrent neural network.
