"Serious games are receiving increasing attention in the field of Cultural Heritage CH applications. A special field of CH and education is Intangible Cultural Heritage and particularly dance. Machine learning ML tools are necessary elements for the success of a serious game platform since they introduce intelligence in processing and analysis of users interactivity. ML provides intelligent scoring and monitoring capabilities of the users progress in a serious game platform. In this paper we introduce a deep learning model for motion primitive classification. The model combines a convolutional processing layer with a bi-directional analysis module. This way RGB information is efficiently handled by the hierarchies of convolutions while the bi-directional properties of an LSTM model are retained. The resulting Convolutionally Enhanced Bi-directional LSTM CEBi-LSTM architecture is less sensitive to skeleton errors occurring using low-cost sensors such as Kinect while simultaneously handling the high amount of detail when using RGB visual information."
