A growing field of research explores links between behavioral measures and functional connectivity FC assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recent studies suggest that measurement of these relationships may be corrupted by head motion artifact. Using data from the Human Connectome Project HCP we find that a surprising number of behavioral demographic and physiological measures 23 of 122 including fluid intelligence reading ability weight and psychiatric diagnostic scales correlate with head motion. We demonstrate that "trait" across-subject and "state" across-day within-subject effects of motion on FC are remarkably similar in HCP data suggesting that state effects of motion could potentially mimic trait correlates of behavior. Thus head motion is a likely source of systematic errors bias in the measurement of FC:behavior relationships. Next we show that data cleaning strategies reduce the influence of head motion and substantially alter previously reported FC:behavior relationship. Our results suggest that spurious relationships mediated by head motion may be widespread in studies linking FC to behavior.
