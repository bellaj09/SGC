Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures which affects about one percent of the worlds population. Most of the current seizure detection approaches strongly rely on patient history records and thus fail in the patient-independent situation of detecting the new patients. To overcome such limitation we propose a robust and explainable epileptic seizure detection model that effectively learns from seizure states while eliminates the inter-patient noises. A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive electroencephalography EEG signals through adversarial training. Furthermore to enhance the explainability we develop an attention mechanism to automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure diagnosis procedure. The proposed approach is evaluated over the Temple University Hospital EEG TUH EEG database. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines with low latency. Moreover the designed attention mechanism is demonstrated ables to provide fine-grained information for pathological analysis. We propose an effective and efficient patient-independent diagnosis approach of epileptic seizure based on raw EEG signals without manually feature engineering which is a step toward the development of large-scale deployment for real-life use.
