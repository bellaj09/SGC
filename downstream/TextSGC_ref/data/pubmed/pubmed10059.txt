Wound assessment no longer relies only on manual measurements since optical devices can accurately capture its 3D shape and label tissues across wound bed. However in order to be routinely used in the clinical setting compact user-friendly devices are preliminary requirements before to be accepted by the nurses in charge of wound care. Low-cost wound size imaging devices now address range finding hyperspectral resolution and thermal sensing. Multimodal system performance will not be the addition but the multiplication of single modalities and offer precise and reliable wound assessment. The emergence of deep learning is also expected to be promising for tissue analysis. The marketed devices do not embed the latest technological advances but routine wound care will soon take advantage of it. Indeed the reduction of health system spending is driving the emergence of the devices marketed in the coming years and mobile health should undergo a spectacular development with the integration of enhanced imaging hardware and software tools in smartphones.
