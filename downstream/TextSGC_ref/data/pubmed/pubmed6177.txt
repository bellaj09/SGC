For the connectome of primo vascular system some long-type primo vessels dyed with Alcian blue injected into inguinal nodes abdominal node and axially nodes were visualized which passed over around the vena cava of the rabbit. The Alcian blue dye revealed primo vessels and colored blue in the rabbit lymph vessels. The length of long-type primo vessels was 18\xa0cm on average of which diameters were about 20-30\xa0m and the lymph vessels had diameters of 100-150\xa0m. Three different tissues of pure primo vessel mixed primo\xa0+\xa0lymph vessel and only lymph vessel were made to undergo RNA-Seq analysis by next-generation sequencing. We also analyzed differentially expressed genes DEGs from the RNA-Seq data in which 30 genes of the primo vessels primo\xa0+\xa0lymph vessels and lymph vessels were selected for primo marker candidates. From the plot of DEG analysis 10 genes had remarkably different expression pattern on the Group 1 primo vessel vs Group 3 lymph vessel. With Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million the cutoff p-value for each gene was < 0.05. Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million of the 10 genes such as IGHM HLA-DRA HIST1H41 LPL CD36 SRGN DGAT2 SNCG CD48 and GPD1 for primo vessels compared with those of lymph vessels increased twice or thrice. These results suggest that the selected genes could be used for the specific marker to construct primo connectome of circuit system in the rabbit.
