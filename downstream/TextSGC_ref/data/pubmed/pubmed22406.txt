Simulation-based training SBT provides a safe environment and effective means to enhance skills development. Simulation-based curricula have been developed for a number of procedures including gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gamification which is the application of game-design principles to non-game contexts is an instructional strategy with potential to enhance learning. No studies have investigated the effects of a comprehensive gamification curriculum on the acquisition of endoscopic skills among novice endoscopists. Protocol for a randomised trial evaluating the effect of applying gamification to simulation-based endoscopy training.
