US soldiers injured in Iraq and civilian burn trauma patients are treated at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research. Burn patients experience extreme pain during wound care and they typically receive opioid analgesics and anxiolytics for debridement. Virtual Reality VR has been applied as an adjunct to opioid analgesics for procedural pain. We describe the first use of ketamine combined with immersive VR to reduce excessive pain during wound care. Combining ketamine and virtual reality pain control during severe burn wound care: one military and one civilian patient.
