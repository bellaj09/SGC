Preterm infants show abnormal structural and functional brain development and have a high risk of long-term neurocognitive problems. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved are poorly understood but novel methods now make it possible to address them by examining the relationship between common genetic variability and brain endophenotype. We addressed the hypothesis that variability in the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor PPAR pathway would be related to brain development. We employed machine learning in an unsupervised unbiased combined analysis of whole-brain diffusion tractography together with genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP-based genotypes from a cohort of 272 preterm infants using Sparse Reduced Rank Regression sRRR and correcting for ethnicity and age at birth and imaging. Empirical selection frequencies for SNPs associated with cerebral connectivity ranged from 0.663 to zero with multiple highly selected SNPs mapping to genes for PPARG six SNPs ITGA6 four SNPs and FXR1 two SNPs. SNPs in PPARG were significantly overrepresented ranked 7-11 and 67 of 556000 SNPs; P < 2.2  10-7 and were mostly in introns or regulatory regions with predicted effects including protein coding and nonsense-mediated decay. Edge-centric graph-theoretic analysis showed that highly selected white-matter tracts were consistent across the group and important for information transfer P < 2.2  10-17; they most often connected to the insula P < 6  10-17. These results suggest that the inhibited brain development seen in humans exposed to the stress of a premature extrauterine environment is modulated by genetic factors and that PPARG signaling has a previously unrecognized role in cerebral development. Machine learning shows association between genetic variability in PPARG and cerebral connectivity in preterm infants.
