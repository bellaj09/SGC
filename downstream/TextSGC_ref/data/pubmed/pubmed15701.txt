With the widespread use of the Global Positioning System indoor positioning technology has attracted increasing attention. Many systems with distinct deployment costs and positioning accuracies have been developed over the past decade for indoor positioning. The method that is based on received signal strength RSS is the most widely used. However manually measuring RSS signal values to build a fingerprint database is costly and time-consuming and it is impractical in a dynamic environment with a large positioning area. In this study we propose an indoor positioning system that is based on the deep Gaussian process regression DGPR model. This model is a nonparametric model and it only needs to measure part of the reference points thus reducing the time and cost required for data collection. The model converts the RSS values into four types of characterizing values as input data and then predicts the position coordinates using DGPR. Finally after reinforcement learning the position coordinates are optimized. The authors conducted several experiments on a simulated environment by MATLAB and physical environments at Tianjin University. The experiments examined different environments different kernels and positioning accuracy. The results showed that the proposed method could not only retain the positioning accuracy but also save the computation time that is required for location estimation.
