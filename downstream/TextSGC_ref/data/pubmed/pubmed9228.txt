Early assessment of renal allograft function post-transplantation is crucial to minimize and control allograft rejection. Biopsy - the gold standard - is used only as a last resort due to its invasiveness high cost adverse events e.g. bleeding infection etc. and the time for reporting. To overcome these limitations a renal computer-assisted diagnostic Renal-CAD system was developed to assess kidney transplant function. A multimodal computer-aided diagnostic system for precise identification of renal allograft rejection: Preliminary results.
