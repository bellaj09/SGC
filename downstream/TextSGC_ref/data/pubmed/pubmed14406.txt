It is well known that DNA sequence contains a certain amount of transcription factors TF binding sites and only part of them are identified through biological experiments. However these experiments are expensive and time-consuming. To overcome these problems some computational methods based on k-mer features or convolutional neural networks have been proposed to identify TF binding sites from DNA sequences. Although these methods have good performance the context information that relates to TF binding sites is still lacking. Research indicates that standard recurrent neural networks RNN and its variants have better performance in time-series data compared with other models. In this study we propose a model named KEGRU to identify TF binding sites by combining Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit GRU network with k-mer embedding. Firstly DNA sequences are divided into k-mer sequences with a specified length and stride window. And then we treat each k-mer as a word and pre-trained word representation model though word2vec algorithm. Thirdly we construct a deep bidirectional GRU model for feature learning and classification. Experimental results have shown that our method has better performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods. Additional experiments about embedding strategy show that k-mer embedding will be helpful to enhance model performance. The robustness of KEGRU is proved by experiments with different k-mer length stride window and embedding vector dimension. Recurrent Neural Network for Predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites.
