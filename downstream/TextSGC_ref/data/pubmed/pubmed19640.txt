Immersive virtual reality VR has enormous potential for education but classroom resources are limited. Thus it is important to identify whether and when VR provides sufficient advantages over other modes of learning to justify its deployment. In a between-subjects experiment we compared three methods of teaching Moon phases a hands-on activity VR and a desktop simulation and measured student improvement on existing learning and attitudinal measures. While a substantial majority of students preferred the VR experience we found no significant differences in learning between conditions. However we found differences between conditions based on gender which was highly correlated with experience with video games. These differences may indicate certain groups have an advantage in the VR setting. Ready student one: Exploring the predictors of student learning in virtual reality.
