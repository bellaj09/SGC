Free-breathing three-dimensional 3D abdominal imaging is a challenging task for MRI as respiratory motion severely degrades image quality. One of the most promising self-navigation techniques is the 3D golden-angle radial stack-of-stars SOS sequence which has advantages in terms of speed resolution and allowing free breathing. However streaking artifacts are still clearly observed in reconstructed images when undersampling is applied. This work presents a novel reconstruction approach based on a stacked convolutional auto-encoder SCAE network to solve this problem.
