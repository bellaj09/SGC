Non-coding RNA ncRNA are small non-coding sequences involved in gene expression regulation of many biological processes and diseases. The recent discovery of a large set of different ncRNAs with biologically relevant roles has opened the way to develop methods able to discriminate between the different ncRNA classes. Moreover the lack of knowledge about the complete mechanisms in regulative processes together with the development of high-throughput technologies has required the help of bioinformatics tools in addressing biologists and clinicians with a deeper comprehension of the functional roles of ncRNAs. In this work we introduce a new ncRNA classification tool nRC non-coding RNA Classifier. Our approach is based on features extraction from the ncRNA secondary structure together with a supervised classification algorithm implementing a deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks. nRC: non-coding RNA Classifier based on structural features.
