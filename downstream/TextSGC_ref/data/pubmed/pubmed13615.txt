Functional MRI fMRI is a popular and important tool for noninvasive mapping of neural activity. As fMRI measures the hemodynamic response the resulting activation maps do not perfectly reflect the underlying neural activity. The purpose of this work was to design a data-driven model to improve the spatial accuracy of fMRI maps in the rat olfactory bulb. This system is an ideal choice for this investigation since the bulb circuit is well characterized allowing for an accurate definition of activity patterns in order to train the model. We generated models for both cerebral blood volume weighted CBVw and blood oxygen level dependent BOLD fMRI data. The results indicate that the spatial accuracy of the activation maps is either significantly improved or at worst not significantly different when using the learned models compared to a conventional general linear model approach particularly for BOLD images and activity patterns involving deep layers of the bulb. Furthermore the activation maps computed by CBVw and BOLD data show increased agreement when using the learned models lending more confidence to their accuracy. The models presented here could have an immediate impact on studies of the olfactory bulb but perhaps more importantly demonstrate the potential for similar flexible data-driven models to improve the quality of activation maps calculated using fMRI data.
