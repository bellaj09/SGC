Since 2010 substantial progress has been made in artificial intelligence AI and its application to medicine. AI is explored in gastroenterology for endoscopic analysis of lesions in detection of cancer and to facilitate the analysis of inflammatory lesions or gastrointestinal bleeding during wireless capsule endoscopy. AI is also tested to assess liver fibrosis and to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer from those with pancreatitis. AI might also be used to establish prognoses of patients or predict their response to treatments based on multiple factors. We review the ways in which AI may help physicians make a diagnosis or establish a prognosis and discuss its limitations knowing that further randomized controlled studies will be required before the approval of AI techniques by the health authorities. Application of Artificial Intelligence to Gastroenterology and Hepatology.
