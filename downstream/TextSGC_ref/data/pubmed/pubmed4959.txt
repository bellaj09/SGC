Previous neuroimaging studies examining relations between alcohol misuse and cortical thickness have revealed that increased drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems are associated with thinner cortex. Although conflicting regional effects are often observed associations are generally localized to frontal regions e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC inferior frontal gyrus IFG and anterior cingulate cortex. Inconsistent findings may be attributed to methodological differences modest sample sizes and limited consideration of sex differences.
