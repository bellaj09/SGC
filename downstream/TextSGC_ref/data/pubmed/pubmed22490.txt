The reaching of objects is usually practiced by CP children in conventional or Virtual Reality-based therapies to enhance motor skill performance. Recently Kinesio Taping method has been studied to increase mechanical stability and improve functional movement of the upper limb; however its influence on CP childrens upper limb motion has been rarely quantified due to lack of sensory measurement. Therefore in this paper we evaluate the biomechanical and functional effects of applying shoulder Kinesio Taping on CP children in the reaching-transporting of virtual objects by using a low-cost tracking device exact robust differentiation of data and a simple nonlinear biomechanical dynamic model of the trunk and arm. Biomechanical and functional effects of shoulder kinesio taping on cerebral palsy children interacting with virtual objects.
