We have developed a deep generative model generative tensorial reinforcement learning GENTRL for de novo small-molecule design. GENTRL optimizes synthetic feasibility novelty and biological activity. We used GENTRL to discover potent inhibitors of discoidin domain receptor 1 DDR1 a kinase target implicated in fibrosis and other diseases in 21 days. Four compounds were active in biochemical assays and two were validated in cell-based assays. One lead candidate was tested and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics in mice. Deep learning enables rapid identification of potent DDR1 kinase inhibitors.
