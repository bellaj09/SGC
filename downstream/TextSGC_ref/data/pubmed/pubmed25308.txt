The United States has been at war since 2003. During that time training using Medical Simulation technology has been developed and integrated into military medical training for combat medics nurses and surgeons. Efforts stemming from the Joint Programmatic Committee-1 JPC-1 Medical Simulation and Training Portfolio has allowed for the improvement and advancement in military medical training by focusing on research in simulation training technology in order to achieve this. Based upon lessons learned capability gaps have been identified concerning the necessity to validate and enhance combat medial training simulators. These capability gaps include 1 Open Source/Open Architecture; 2 Modularity and Interoperability; and 3 Material and Virtual Reality VR Models. Using the capability gaps JPC-1 has identified important research endeavors that need to be explored. The Evolution of Medical Training Simulation in the U.S. Military.
