A key concern for people with chronic pain is experiencing increased pain and/or re-injury. Consequently individuals with chronic pain can develop a maladaptive fear of movement that leads to adverse functional consequences. A primary goal of chronic pain rehabilitation is re-engagement in feared movements through exposure. This is often challenging since safe movement can be uncomfortable. Virtual environments provide a promising opportunity to safely and gradually expose Veterans to movements that are avoided in the real world. The current study will utilize multiple virtual reality VR applications APPs of varying the intensity levels ranging from passive distraction from pain to active exposure to feared movement. The primary aims of this pilot are to examine VR as an adjunctive nonpharmacological intervention to assist with the adoption and implementation of skills to decrease fear of movement and increase overall functioning among Veterans with chronic pain. Second to build a hierarchy of VR APPs to assist in gradual exposure to feared movements. A virtual reality intervention for fear of movement for Veterans with chronic pain: protocol for a feasibility study.
