"This study provides preliminary evidence for the validity of the Bahasa Indonesian version of the Study Process Questionnaire BI-SPQ from a sample of 147 psychology students 22 men and 125 women; M age = 21.8 yr. SD = 1.3. The internal consistency alpha of the BI-SPQ subscales were found to range from .46 Surface Strategy to .77 Deep Strategy with a median of .67. Principal component analysis indicated a two-factor solution where the Deep and Achieving subscales loaded onto Factor 1 and the Surface subscales loaded on Factor 2. Students GPAs were associated negatively with Surface Motive r = -.24 and were associated positively with Deep and Achieving Motives rs = .20. Further studies with larger samples involving students majoring in other disciplines are needed to provide further evidence of the validity of the BI-SPQ."
