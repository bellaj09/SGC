The aim of this study was to assess the performance curve for novices training in bimanual tissue manipulation and angled laparoscope navigation and compare those performances with the performances of experienced laparoscopic surgeons. The Camera Navigation task with a 30 degrees angled laparoscope and the Place Arrow task of the new SimSurgery SEP virtual reality simulator were used. Fourteen medical trainees no laparoscopy experience performed four training sessions within one week including 15 repetitions of each task in total. The experienced participants >50 procedures & familiar with angled laparoscope performed each task twice. The performance on both tasks by the novices improved significantly over the training sessions. The experienced participants performed both tasks significantly better than the novices in repetition 3. After repetition 15 the performances of the novices on both tasks were of the same level as the performances of the experienced participants. By training on SimSurgery SEP medical trainees can extensively improve their skills in navigation with 30 degrees angled laparoscope and bimanual tissue manipulation. Further research should focus on the transfer of skills acquired on the simulator to the clinical setting. Knowledge on proficiency thresholds and training end-points for pre-clinical criterion-based training of different laparoscopic tasks also needs to be extended. Training of basic laparoscopy skills on SimSurgery SEP.
