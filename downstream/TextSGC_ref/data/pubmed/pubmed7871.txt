"Neuromelanin sensitive magnetic resonance imaging NMS-MRI has been crucial in identifying abnormalities in the substantia nigra pars compacta SNc in Parkinsons disease PD as PD is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Current techniques employ estimation of contrast ratios of the SNc visualized on NMS-MRI to discern PD patients from the healthy controls. However the extraction of these features is time-consuming and laborious and moreover provides lower prediction accuracies. Furthermore these do not account for patterns of subtle changes in PD in the SNc. To mitigate this our work establishes a computer-based analysis technique that uses convolutional neural networks CNNs to create prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of PD from NMS-MRI. Our technique not only performs with a superior testing accuracy 80% as compared to contrast ratio-based classification 56.5% testing accuracy and radiomics classifier 60.3% testing accuracy but also supports discriminating PD from atypical parkinsonian syndromes 85.7% test accuracy. Moreover it has the capability to locate the most discriminative regions on the neuromelanin contrast images. These discriminative activations demonstrate that the left SNc plays a key role in the classification in comparison to the right SNc and are in agreement with the concept of asymmetry in PD. Overall the proposed technique has the potential to support radiological diagnosis of PD while facilitating deeper understanding into the abnormalities in SNc."
