Adverse side effects of drug-drug interactions induced by human cytochrome P450 CYP450 inhibition is an important consideration in drug discovery. It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitive effect of a compound against a specific CYP450 isoform. In this study we developed a multitask model for concurrent inhibition prediction of five major CYP450 isoforms namely 1A2 2C9 2C19 2D6 and 3A4. The model was built by training a multitask autoencoder deep neural network DNN on a large dataset containing more than 13\u202f000 compounds extracted from the PubChem BioAssay Database. We demonstrate that the multitask model gave better prediction results than that of single-task models previous reported classifiers and traditional machine learning methods on an average of five prediction tasks. Our multitask DNN model gave average prediction accuracies of 86.4% for the 10-fold cross-validation and 88.7% for the external test datasets. In addition we built linear regression models to quantify how the other tasks contributed to the prediction difference of a given task between single-task and multitask models and we explained under what conditions the multitask model will outperform the single-task model which suggested how to use multitask DNN models more effectively. We applied sensitivity analysis to extract useful knowledge about CYP450 inhibition which may shed light on the structural features of these isoforms and give hints about how to avoid side effects during drug development.
