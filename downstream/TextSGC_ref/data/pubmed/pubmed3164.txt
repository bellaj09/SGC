"Resting-state fMRI allows investigation of alterations in functional brain organization that are associated with an underlying pathological process. We determine whether abnormal connectivity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS in a priori-defined intrinsic functional connectivity networks according to a neuropathological staging scheme and its DTI-based tract correlates permits recognition of a sequential involvement of functional networks. Resting-state fMRI data from 135 ALS patients and 56 matched healthy controls were investigated for the motor network corresponding to neuropathological stage 1 brainstem stage 2 ventral attention stage 3 default mode/hippocampal network stage 4 and primary visual network as the control network in a cross-sectional analysis and longitudinally in a subgroup of 27 patients after 6 months. Group comparison from cross-sectional and longitudinal data revealed significantly increased functional connectivity p\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected in all four investigated networks but not in the control network presenting as a network expansion that was correlated with physical disability. Increased connectivity of functional networks as investigated in a hypothesis-driven approach is characterized by network expansions and resembled the pattern of pTDP-43 pathology in ALS. However our data did not allow for the recognition of a sequential involvement of functional connectivity networks at the individual level." Functional connectivity changes resemble patterns of pTDP-43 pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
