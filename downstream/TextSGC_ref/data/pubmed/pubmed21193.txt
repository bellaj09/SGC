Although regular physical activities reduce mortality and increase quality of life many cardiac patients discontinue training due to lack of motivation lack of time or having health concerns because of a too high training intensity. Therefore we developed an exergaming based system to enhance long-term motivation in the context of rehabilitation training. We combined different hardware components such as vital sensors a virtual reality headset a motion detecting camera a bicycle ergometer and a motion platform to create an immersive and fun experience for the training user without having to worry about any negative health impact. Our evaluation shows that the system is well accepted by the users and is capable of tackling the aforementioned reasons for an inactive lifestyle. The system is designed to be easily extensible safe to use and enables professionals to adjust and to telemonitor the training at any time.
