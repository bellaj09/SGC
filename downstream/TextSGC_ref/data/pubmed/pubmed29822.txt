Direct electronic communication with sensory areas of the neocortex is a challenging ambition for brain-computer interfaces. Here we report the first successful neural decoding of English words with high intelligibility from intracortical spike-based neural population activity recorded from the secondary auditory cortex of macaques. We acquired 96-channel full-broadband population recordings using intracortical microelectrode arrays in the rostral and caudal parabelt regions of the superior temporal gyrus STG. We leveraged a new neural processing toolkit to investigate the choice of decoding algorithm neural preprocessing audio representation channel count and array location on neural decoding performance. The presented spike-based machine learning neural decoding approach may further be useful in informing future encoding strategies to deliver direct auditory percepts to the brain as specific patterns of microstimulation.
