The hallmark pathology underlying Parkinson disease PD is progressive synucleinopathy beginning in caudal brainstem that later spreads rostrally. However the primarily subcortical pathology fails to account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in PD. To reconcile these observations resting-state functional connectivity FC can be used to examine dysfunction across distributed brain networks. We measured FC in a large single-site study of nondemented PD N = 107; OFF medications and healthy controls N = 46 incorporating rigorous quality control measures and comprehensive sampling of cortical subcortical and cerebellar regions. We employed novel statistical approaches to determine group differences across the entire connectome at the network-level and for select brain regions. Group differences respected well-characterized network delineations producing a striking "block-wise" pattern of network-to-network effects. Surprisingly these results demonstrate that the greatest FC differences involve sensorimotor thalamic and cerebellar networks with notably smaller striatal effects. Split-half replication demonstrates the robustness of these results. Finally block-wise FC correlations with behavior suggest that FC disruptions may contribute to clinical manifestations in PD. Overall these results indicate a concerted breakdown of functional network interactions remote from primary pathophysiology and suggest that FC deficits in PD are related to emergent network-level phenomena rather than focal pathology.
