Suturing with intracorporeal knot-tying is one of the five tasks of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery FLS which is a pre-requisite for board certification in general surgery. This task involves placing a short suture through two marks in a penrose drain and then tying a double-throw knot followed by two single-throw knots using two needle graspers operated by both hands. A virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer VBLaST is being developed to represent the virtual versions of the FLS tasks including automated real time performance measurement and feedback. In this paper we present the development of a VBLaST suturing simulator VBLaST-SS. Developing such a simulator involves solving multiple challenges associated with fast collision detection response and force feedback.
