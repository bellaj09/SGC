There is an increasing demand for acquiring details of food nutrients especially among those who are sensitive to food intakes and weight changes. To meet this need we propose a new approach based on deep learning that precisely estimates the composition of carbohydrates proteins and fats from hyperspectral signals of foods obtained by using low-cost spectrometers. Specifically we develop a system consisting of multiple deep neural networks for estimating food nutrients followed by detecting and discarding estimation anomalies. Our comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system can maximize estimation accuracy by automatically identifying wrong estimations. As such if consolidated with the capability of reinforcement learning it will likely be positioned as a promising means for personalized healthcare in terms of food safety.
