One of the primary difference of mankind from other species is his ability to communicate verbally. Our brain upon framing a sentence coordinates with the oro-pharyngeal-laryngeal muscle groups to produce the speech with the help of vocal cord and mouth aperture. However some individuals due to congenital or illness may loose their ability to speak in spite of their brain framing speech. Research on speech restoration through brain computer interface BCI is still at an early stage. Through this study we have explored the regression between the chaos parameters of acoustic signal and electroencephalography EEG signal for different vowels chosen from International Phonetic Alphabets IPA. The vowels were categorised into two categories namely soft vowels and diphthongs. We have selected the EEG channels based on their higher contribution towards the first principal component. Goodness of fit parameters were evaluated for the regression analysis to explore the most suitable chaos parameter. Regression between EEG and Speech Signals for Spoken Vowels.
