Aberration in tissue architecture is an essential index for cancer diagnosis and tumor grading. Therefore extracting features of aberrant phenotypes and classification of the histology tissue can provide a model for computer-aided pathology CAP. As a case study we investigate the application of convolutional neural networks CNNs for tumor grading and decomposing tumor architecture from hematoxylin and eosin H&E stained histology sections of kidney. The former and latter contribute to CAP and the role of the tumor architecture on the outcome e.g. survival respectively. A training set is constructed and sample images are classified into six categories of normal fat blood stroma low-grade granular tumor and high-grade clear cell carcinoma. We have compared the performances of a deep versus shallow networks and shown that the deeper model outperforms the shallow network. Deep Learning Models Differentiate Tumor Grades from H&E Stained Histology Sections.
