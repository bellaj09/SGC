Tumors are characterized by somatic mutations that drive biological processes ultimately reflected in tumor phenotype. With regard to radiographic phenotypes generally unconnected through present understanding to the presence of specific mutations artificial intelligence methods can automatically quantify phenotypic characters by using predefined engineered algorithms or automatic deep-learning methods a process also known as radiomics. Here we demonstrate how imaging phenotypes can be connected to somatic mutations through an integrated analysis of independent datasets of 763 lung adenocarcinoma patients with somatic mutation testing and engineered CT image analytics. We developed radiomic signatures capable of distinguishing between tumor genotypes in a discovery cohort n = 353 and verified them in an independent validation cohort n = 352. All radiomic signatures significantly outperformed conventional radiographic predictors tumor volume and maximum diameter. We found a radiomic signature related to radiographic heterogeneity that successfully discriminated between EGFR+ and EGFR- cases AUC = 0.69. Combining this signature with a clinical model of EGFR status AUC = 0.70 significantly improved prediction accuracy AUC = 0.75. The highest performing signature was capable of distinguishing between EGFR+ and KRAS+ tumors AUC = 0.80 and when combined with a clinical model AUC = 0.81 substantially improved its performance AUC = 0.86. A KRAS+/KRAS- radiomic signature also showed significant albeit lower performance AUC = 0.63 and did not improve the accuracy of a clinical predictor of KRAS status. Our results argue that somatic mutations drive distinct radiographic phenotypes that can be predicted by radiomics. This work has implications for the use of imaging-based biomarkers in the clinic as applied noninvasively repeatedly and at low cost. Cancer Res; 7714; 3922-30. 2017 AACR.
