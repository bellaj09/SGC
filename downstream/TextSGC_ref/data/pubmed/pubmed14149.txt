The use of natural language data for animal population surveillance represents a valuable opportunity to gather information about potential disease outbreaks emerging zoonotic diseases or bioterrorism threats. In this study we evaluate machine learning methods for conducting syndromic surveillance using free-text veterinary necropsy reports. We train a system to detect if a necropsy report from the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory contains evidence of gastrointestinal respiratory or urinary pathology. We evaluate the performance of several machine learning algorithms including deep learning with a long short-term memory network. Although no single algorithm was superior random forest using feature vectors of TF-IDF statistics ranked among the top-performing models with F1 scores of 0.923 gastrointestinal 0.960 respiratory and 0.888 urinary. This model was applied to over 33000 necropsy reports and was used to describe temporal and spatial features of diseases within a 14-year period exposing epidemiological trends and detecting a potential focus of gastrointestinal disease from a single submitting producer in the fall of 2016.
