Virtual Reality for surgical training is mainly focused on technical surgical skills. We work on providing a novel approach to the use of Virtual Reality focusing on the procedural aspects. Our system relies on a specific work-flow generating a model of the procedure from real case surgery observation in the operating room. This article presents the different technologies created in the context of our project and their relations as other components of our workflow. Synthesis and Simulation of Surgical Process Models.
