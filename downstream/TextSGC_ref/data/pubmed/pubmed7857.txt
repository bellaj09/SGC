Median lethal death LD50 is a general indicator of compound acute oral toxicity AOT. Various in silico methods were developed for AOT prediction to reduce costs and time. In this study we developed an improved molecular graph encoding convolutional neural networks MGE-CNN architecture to construct three types of high-quality AOT models: regression model deepAOT-R multiclassification model deepAOT-C and multitask model deepAOT-CR. These predictive models highly outperformed previously reported models. For the two external data sets containing 1673 test set I and 375 test set II compounds the R2 and mean absolute errors MAEs of deepAOT-R on the test set I were 0.864 and 0.195 and the prediction accuracies of deepAOT-C were 95.5% and 96.3% on test sets I and II respectively. The two external prediction accuracies of deepAOT-CR are 95.0% and 94.1% while the R2 and MAE are 0.861 and 0.204 for test set I respectively. We then performed forward and backward exploration of deepAOT models for deep fingerprints which could support shallow machine learning methods more efficiently than traditional fingerprints or descriptors. We further performed automatic feature learning a key essence of deep learning to map the corresponding activation values into fragment space and derive AOT-related chemical substructures by reverse mining of the features. Our deep learning architecture for AOT is generally applicable in predicting and exploring other toxicity or property end points of chemical compounds.
