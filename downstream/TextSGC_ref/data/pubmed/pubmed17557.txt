In the course of a densitometric evaluation the histochemically demonstrated reactivity of succinic acid dehydrogenase SDH and of NADPH-diaphorase NADPHD was determined in different brain nuclei of two teleost fish cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus swordtail fish Xiphophorus helleri which had been kept under 3g hyper-gravity for 8 days. SDH was chosen since it is a rate limiting enzyme of the Krebs cycle and therefore it is regarded as a marker for metabolic and neuronal activity. NADPHD reactivity reflects the activity of nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide NO is a gaseous intercellular messenger that has been suggested to play a major role in several different in vivo models of neuronal plasticity including learning. Within particular vestibulum-connected brain centers significant effects of hyper-gravity were obtained e.g. in the magnocellular nucleus a primary vestibular relay ganglion of the brain stem octavolateralis area in the superior rectus subdivision of the oculomotoric nucleus and within cerebellar eurydendroid cells which in teleosts possibly resemble the deep cerebellar nucleus of higher vertebrates. Non-vestibulum related nuclei did not respond to hyper-gravity in a significant way. The effect of hyper-gravity found was much less distinct in adult animals as compared to the circumstances seen in larval fish Anken et al. Adv. Space Res. 17 1996 possibly due to a development correlated loss of neuronal plasticity. Influence of long-term hyper-gravity on the reactivity of succinic acid dehydrogenase and NADPH-diaphorase in the central nervous system of fish: a histochemical study.
