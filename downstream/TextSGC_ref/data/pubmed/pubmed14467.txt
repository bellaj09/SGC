Convolutional neural network CNN-based systems are increasingly used in autonomous vehicles for detecting obstacles. CNN-based object detection and per-pixel classification semantic segmentation algorithms are trained for detecting and classifying a predefined set of object types. These algorithms have difficulties in detecting distant and heavily occluded objects and are by definition not capable of detecting unknown object types or unusual scenarios. The visual characteristics of an agriculture field is homogeneous and obstacles like people animals and other obstacles occur rarely and are of distinct appearance compared to the field. This paper introduces DeepAnomaly an algorithm combining deep learning and anomaly detection to exploit the homogenous characteristics of a field to perform anomaly detection. We demonstrate DeepAnomaly as a fast state-of-the-art detector for obstacles that are distant heavily occluded and unknown. DeepAnomaly is compared to state-of-the-art obstacle detectors including "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks" RCNN. In a human detector test case we demonstrate that DeepAnomaly detects humans at longer ranges 45-90 m than RCNN. RCNN has a similar performance at a short range 0-30 m. However DeepAnomaly has much fewer model parameters and 182 ms/25 ms = a 7.28-times faster processing time per image. Unlike most CNN-based methods the high accuracy the low computation time and the low memory footprint make it suitable for a real-time system running on a embedded GPU Graphics Processing Unit.
