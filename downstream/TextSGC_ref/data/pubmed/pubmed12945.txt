The deep layers of the superior colliculus DLSC and the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter DPAG have been implicated in the control of defensive-like behaviors. Electrical and chemical stimulation of these structures elicits fear and escape behaviour expressed by immobility freezing and wild running followed by jumps and rapid rotations. There is evidence that the neural substrates responsible for defensive behavior in this level of the midbrain tectum MT may also be responsible for fear-induced analgesia. This study was aimed at examining the characteristics of the analgesia that follows the defense-oriented reactions induced by electrical midbrain tectum stimulation at freezing and escape thresholds. The animals were submitted to the tail-flick test following the induction of the defense behavioral responses. The obtained results show that the antinociception that follows the freezing and escape behaviors were not antagonized by MT microinjections of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. These results emphasize previous data showing the non-opioid nature of this analgesia. On the other hand the fear-induced analgesia was inhibited by microinjections of the serotonergic blockers methysergide and ketanserin in the MT. Since methysergide is a non-specific antagonist of 5-HT receptors and ketanserin acts with a high degree of specificity at 5-HT2 receptors the present results suggest that activation of 5-HT2 receptors may be implicated in the antinociception induced by midbrain tectum stimulation. Effects of 5-HT2 receptors blockade on fear-induced analgesia elicited by electrical stimulation of the deep layers of the superior colliculus and dorsal periaqueductal gray.
