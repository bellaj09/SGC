"Evidences suggested that both corpus callosum CC degeneration and alternations of homotopic inter-hemispheric functional connectivity FC are present in Alzheimers disease AD. However the associations between region-specific CC degeneration and homotopic inter-hemispheric FC and their relationships with memory deficits in AD remain uncharacterized. We hypothesized that selective CC degeneration is associated with memory impairment in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment aMCI which is mediated by homotopic inter-hemispheric functional dysconnectivity. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI and task-free functional MRI we assessed the CC volume and inter-hemispheric FC in 66 healthy controls 41 aMCI and 41 AD. As expected AD had CC degeneration and attenuated inter-hemispheric homotopic FC. Nevertheless aMCI had relatively less severe CC degeneration mainly in mid-anterior central and mid-posterior and no reduction in inter-hemispheric homotopic FC. The degeneration of each CC sub-region was associated with specific inter-hemispheric homotopic functional disconnections in AD and aMCI. More importantly impairment of inter-hemispheric homotopic FC partially mediated the association between CC particularly the central and posterior parts degeneration and memory deficit. Notably these results remained after controlling for hippocampal volume. Our findings shed light on how CC degeneration and the related inter-hemispheric FC impact memory impairment in early stage of AD." Inter-hemispheric functional dysconnectivity mediates the association of corpus callosum degeneration with memory impairment in AD and amnestic MCI.
