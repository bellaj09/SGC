Brain-computer interface BCI studies based on electroencephalography EEG measured around the ears ear-EEGs have mostly used exogenous paradigms involving brain activity evoked by external stimuli. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of ear-EEGs for development of an endogenous BCI system that uses self-modulated brain activity. We performed preliminary and main experiments where EEGs were measured on the scalp and behind the ears to check the reliability of ear-EEGs as compared to scalp-EEGs. In the preliminary and main experiments subjects performed eyes-open and eyes-closed tasks and they performed mental arithmetic MA and light cognitive LC tasks respectively. For data analysis the brain area was divided into four regions of interest ROIs i.e. frontal central occipital and ear area. The preliminary experiment showed that the degree of alpha activity increase of the ear area with eyes closed is comparable to those of other ROIs occipital > ear > central > frontal. In the main experiment similar event-related desynchronization ERD/ERS patterns were observed between the four ROIs during MA and LC and all ROIs showed the mean classification accuracies above 70% required for effective binary communication MA vs. LC occipital = ear = central = frontal. From the results we demonstrated that ear-EEG can be used to develop an endogenous BCI system based on cognitive tasks without external stimuli which allows the usability of ear-EEGs to be extended.
