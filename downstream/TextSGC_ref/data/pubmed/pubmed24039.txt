Previous research shows that virtual reality perspective-taking experiences VRPT can increase prosocial behavior toward others. We extend this research by exploring whether this effect of VRPT is driven by increased empathy and whether the effect extends to ostensibly real-stakes behavioral games. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment N = 180 participants interacted with an ostensible partner a student from the same university as them on a series of real-stakes economic games after a taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality "day-in-the-life" simulation b taking the perspective of a different person in a "day-in-the-life" simulation or c doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants\ subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner a facet of empathy but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants\ reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment. However we found no effects of VRPT experience on behavior in the economic games. Virtual reality perspective-taking increases cognitive empathy for specific others.
