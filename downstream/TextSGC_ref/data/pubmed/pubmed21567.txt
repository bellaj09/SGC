Galvanic vestibular stimulation GVS evokes a perception of rotation; however very few quantitative data exist on the matter. We performed psychophysical experiments on virtual rotations experienced when binaural bipolar electrical stimulation is applied over the mastoids. We also performed analogous real whole body yaw rotation experiments allowing us to compare the frequency response of vestibular perception with real and without virtual natural mechanical stimulation of the semicircular canals. To estimate the gain of vestibular perception we measured direction discrimination thresholds for virtual and real rotations. Real direction discrimination thresholds decreased at higher frequencies confirming multiple previous studies. Conversely virtual direction discrimination thresholds increased at higher frequencies implying low-pass filtering of the virtual perception process occurring potentially anywhere between afferent transduction and cortical responses. To estimate the phase of vestibular perception participants manually tracked their perceived position during sinusoidal virtual and real kinetic stimulation. For real rotations perceived velocity was approximately in phase with actual velocity across all frequencies. Perceived virtual velocity was in phase with the GVS waveform at low frequencies 0.05 and 0.1 Hz. As frequency was increased to 1 Hz the phase of perceived velocity advanced relative to the GVS waveform. Therefore at low frequencies GVS is interpreted as an angular velocity signal and at higher frequencies GVS becomes interpreted increasingly as an angular position signal. These estimated gain and phase spectra for vestibular perception are a first step toward generating well-controlled virtual vestibular percepts an endeavor that may reveal the usefulness of GVS in the areas of clinical assessment neuroprosthetics and virtual reality.
