The performance of brain-machine interfaces BMIs that continuously control upper limb neuroprostheses may benefit from distinguishing periods of posture and movement so as to prevent inappropriate movement of the prosthesis. Few studies however have investigated how decoding behavioral states and detecting the transitions between posture and movement could be used autonomously to trigger a kinematic decoder. We recorded simultaneous neuronal ensemble and local field potential LFP activity from microelectrode arrays in primary motor cortex M1 and dorsal PMd and ventral PMv premotor areas of two male rhesus monkeys performing a center-out reach-and-grasp task while upper limb kinematics were tracked with a motion capture system with markers on the dorsal aspect of the forearm hand and fingers. A state decoder was trained to distinguish four behavioral states baseline reaction movement hold while a kinematic decoder was trained to continuously decode hand end point position and 18 joint angles of the wrist and fingers. LFP amplitude most accurately predicted transition into the reaction 62% and movement 73% states while spikes most accurately decoded arm hand and finger kinematics during movement. Using an LFP-based state decoder to trigger a spike-based kinematic decoder r = 0.72 root mean squared error RMSE = 0.15 significantly improved decoding of reach-to-grasp movements from baseline to final hold compared with either a spike-based state decoder combined with a spike-based kinematic decoder r = 0.70 RMSE = 0.17 or a spike-based kinematic decoder alone r = 0.67 RMSE = 0.17. Combining LFP-based state decoding with spike-based kinematic decoding may be a valuable step toward the realization of BMI control of a multifingered neuroprosthesis performing dexterous manipulation. State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and LFP activity during dexterous reach-to-grasp movements.
