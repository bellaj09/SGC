Virtual Reality technology offers great possibilities for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy of fear of public speaking: Clients can be exposed to virtual fear-triggering stimuli exposure and are able to role-play in virtual environments training social skills to overcome their fear. Usually prototypical audience behavior neutral social and anti-social serves as stimulus in virtual training sessions although there is significant lack of theoretical basis on typical audience behavior. The study presented deals with the design of a realistic virtual presentation scenario. An audience consisting of n=18 men and women in an undergraduate seminar was observed during three frontal lecture sessions. Behavior frequency of four nonverbal dimensions eye contact facial expression gesture and posture was rated by means of a quantitative content analysis. Results show audience behavior patterns which seem to be typical in frontal lecture contexts like friendly and neutral face expressions. Additionally combined and even synchronized behavioral patterns between participants who sit next to each other like turning to the neighbor and start talking were registered. The gathered data serve as empirical design basis for a virtual audience to be used in virtual training applications that stimulate the experiences of the participants in a realistic manner thereby improving the experienced presence in the training application.
