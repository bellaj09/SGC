The development of neuropsychological assessment methods using virtual reality VR is a valid and promising option for the detection of cognitive impairment in the older people focusing on activities composed of tasks of multiple demands. This study verified the association of age schooling and general cognitive status on the performance of neurologically healthy older adults in ECO-VR a VR task of multiple demands for neuropsychological assessment. A total of 111 older adults answered a sociodemographic questionnaire the Mini Mental State Examination the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults third edition and the ECO-VR. Correlation analyses multiple linear regression and comparisons between groups effects by age and schooling groups were used to evaluate the results. The ECO-VR total score was significantly associated with age years of education MMSE and Vocabulary subtest. The linear regression models identified that age was the main predictor for total score and rule breaking of ECO-VR. According to the univariate analysis it was identified the main effect of age group and schooling group in the total ECO-VR score but there was no interaction effect. The results are discussed in order to understand the role of sociodemographic characteristics in the performance of older adults in a VR task of multiple demands. It was also verified the possibility use of VR for neuropsychological assessment of older adults.
