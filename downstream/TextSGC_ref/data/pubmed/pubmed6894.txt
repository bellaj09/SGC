Depersonalization/derealization disorder DPD is a chronic and distressing condition characterized by detachment from oneself and/or the external world. Neuroimaging studies have associated DPD with structural and functional alterations in a variety of distinct brain regions. Such local neuronal changes might be mediated by altered interregional white matter connections. However to our knowledge no research on network characteristics in this patient population exists to date. White matter network alterations in patients with depersonalization/derealization disorder.
