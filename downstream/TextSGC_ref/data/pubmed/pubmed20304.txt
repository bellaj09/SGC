The modern information revolution has facilitated a metamorphosis of health care delivery wrought with the challenges of securing patient sensitive data. To accommodate this reality Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA. While final guidance has not fully been resolved at this time it is up to the health care community to develop and implement comprehensive security strategies founded on procedural hardware and software solutions in preparation for future controls. The Virtual Radiology Environment VRE Project a landmark US Army picture archiving and communications system PACS implemented across 10 geographically dispersed medical facilities has addressed that challenge by planning for the secure transmission of medical images and reports over their local LAN and wide area network WAN infrastructure. Their model which is transferable to general PACS implementations encompasses a strategy of application risk and dataflow identification data auditing security policy definition and procedural controls. When combined with hardware and software solutions that are both non-performance limiting and scalable the comprehensive approach will not only sufficiently address the current security requirements but also accommodate the natural evolution of the enterprise security model. Security model for picture archiving and communication systems.
