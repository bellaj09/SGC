"Over the past few years several approaches have been proposed to assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease AD and its prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment MCI. Using multimodal biomarkers for this high-dimensional classification problem the widely used algorithms include Support Vector Machines SVM Sparse Representation-based classification SRC Deep Belief Networks DBN and Random Forest RF. These widely used algorithms continue to yield unsatisfactory performance for delineating the MCI participants from the cognitively normal control CN group. A novel Gaussian discriminant analysis-based algorithm is thus introduced to achieve a more effective and accurate classification performance than the aforementioned state-of-the-art algorithms. This study makes use of magnetic resonance imaging MRI data uniquely as input to two separate high-dimensional decision spaces that reflect the structural measures of the two brain hemispheres. The data used include 190 CN 305 MCI and 133 AD subjects as part of the AD Big Data DREAM Challenge #1. Using 80% data for a 10-fold cross-validation the proposed algorithm achieved an average F1 score of 95.89% and an accuracy of 96.54% for discriminating AD from CN; and more importantly an average F1 score of 92.08% and an accuracy of 90.26% for discriminating MCI from CN. Then a true test was implemented on the remaining 20% held-out test data. For discriminating MCI from CN an accuracy of 80.61% a sensitivity of 81.97% and a specificity of 78.38% were obtained. These results show significant improvement over existing algorithms for discriminating the subtle differences between MCI participants and the CN group."
