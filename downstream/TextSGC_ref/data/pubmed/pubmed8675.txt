Overweight and obesity are serious issues especially with regard to children. This is because obese children have twice the risk of becoming obese as adults as compared to non-obese children. Nowadays many methods for maintaining a caloric balance exist; however these methods are not applicable to children. In this study a new approach for helping children monitor their activities using a convolutional neural network CNN is proposed which is applicable for real-time scenarios requiring high accuracy. Deep learning-based classification with improved time resolution for physical activities of children.
