Age progression is defined as aesthetically re-rendering the aging face at any future age for an individual face. In this work we aim to automatically render aging faces in a personalized way. Basically for each age group we learn an aging dictionary to reveal its aging characteristics e.g. wrinkles where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from two neighboring aging dictionaries form a particular aging pattern cross these two age groups and a linear combination of all these patterns expresses a particular personalized aging process. Moreover two factors are taken into consideration in the dictionary learning process. First beyond the aging dictionaries each person may have extra personalized facial characteristics e.g. mole which are invariant in the aging process. Second it is challenging or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular person yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups. To this end we propose a novel Bi-level Dictionary Learning based Personalized Age Progression BDL-PAP method. Here bi-level dictionary learning is formulated to learn the aging dictionaries based on face pairs from neighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages of the proposed BDL-PAP over other state-of-the-arts in term of personalized age progression as well as the performance gain for cross-age face verification by synthesizing aging faces.
