Using human electroencephalogram EEG to control external devices in order to achieve a variety of functions has been focus of the field of brain-computer interface BCI research. P300 is experiments which stimulate the eye to produce EEG by using letters flashing and then identify the corresponding letters. In this paper some improvements based on the P300 experiments were made??. Firstly the matrix of flashing letters were modified into words which represent a certain sense. Secondly the BCI2000 procedures were added with the corresponding source code. Thirdly the smart car systems were designed using the radiofrequency signal. Finally it was realized that the evoked potentials were used to control the state of the smart car. Design and implementation of controlling smart car systems using P300 brain-computer interface.
