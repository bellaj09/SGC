"Decision-making systems trained on structural magnetic resonance imaging data of subjects affected by the Alzheimers disease AD and healthy controls CTRL are becoming widespread prognostic tools for subjects with mild cognitive impairment MCI. This study compares the performances of three classification methods based on support vector machines SVMs using as initial sets of brain voxels ie features: 1 the segmented grey matter GM; 2 regions of interest ROIs by voxel-wise t-test filtering; 3 parceled ROIs according to prior knowledge. The recursive feature elimination RFE is applied in all cases to investigate whether feature reduction improves the classification accuracy. We analyzed more than 600 AD Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI subjects training the SVMs on the AD/CTRL dataset and evaluating them on a trial MCI dataset. The classification performance evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC reaches AUC = 88.9  .5% in 20-fold cross-validation on the AD/CTRL dataset when the GM is classified as a whole. The highest discrimination accuracy between MCI converters and nonconverters is achieved when the SVM-RFE is applied to the whole GM: with AUC reaching 70.7  .9% it outperforms both ROI-based approaches in predicting the AD conversion."
