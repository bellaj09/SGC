Transcriptional analyses have identified several distinct molecular subtypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC that have prognostic and potential therapeutic significance. However to date an indepth clinicomorphological correlation of these molecular subtypes has not been performed. We sought to identify specific morphological patterns to compare with known molecular subtypes interrogate their biological significance and furthermore reappraise the current grading system in PDAC. Morphological classification of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that predicts molecular subtypes and correlates with clinical outcome.
