Early decoding of motor states directly from the brain activity is essential to develop brain-machine interfaces BMI for natural motor control of neuroprosthetic devices. Hence this study aimed to investigate the detection of movement information before the actual movement occurs. This information piece could be useful to provide early control signals to drive BMI-based rehabilitation and motor assisted devices thus providing a natural and active rehabilitation therapy. In this work electroencephalographic EEG brain signals from six healthy right-handed participants were recorded during self-initiated reaching movements of the upper limbs. The analysis of these EEG traces showed that significant event-related desynchronization is present before and during the execution of the movements predominantly in the motor-related  and  frequency bands and in electrodes placed above the motor cortex. This oscillatory brain activity was used to continuously detect the intention to move the limbs that is to identify the motor phase prior to the actual execution of the reaching movement. The results showed first significant classification between relax and movement intention and second significant detection of movement intention prior to the onset of the executed movement. On the basis of these results detection of movement intention could be used in BMI settings to reduce the gap between mental motor processes and the actual movement performed by an assisted or rehabilitation robotic device.
