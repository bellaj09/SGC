"Traditionally studies of how pain and attention modulate one another involved explicit cognitive-state manipulations. However emerging evidence suggests that spontaneous brain-wide network communication is intrinsically dynamic on multiple timescales and attentional states are in constant fluctuation. Here in light of studies on neural mechanisms of spontaneous attentional fluctuations and pain variability we introduce the concept of a dynamic pain connectome in the brain. We describe how recent progress in our understanding of individual differences in intrinsic attention to pain and neural network dynamics in chronic pain can facilitate development of personalized pain therapies. Furthermore we emphasize that the dynamics of pain-attention interactions must be accounted for in the contemporary search for a neural signature of the pain connectome." The dynamic pain connectome.
