"The use of wearable devices to study gait and postural control is a growing field on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease AD. In this paper we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines SVMs Multiple Layer Perceptrons MLPs Radial Basis Function Neural Networks RBNs and Deep Belief Networks DBNs on 72 participants 36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables adjusted for age education height and weight with or without neuropsychological evaluation Montreal cognitive assessment MoCA score top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training 50% test 40% and validation 10%. Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics."
