"Astrocytes are complex bushy cells that serve important functions through close contacts between their\xa0processes and synapses. However the spatial interactions and dynamics of astrocyte processes relative to synapses have proven problematic to study in adult living brain tissue. Here we report a\xa0genetically targeted neuron-astrocyte proximity assay NAPA to measure astrocyte-synapse spatial interactions within intact brain preparations and at synaptic distance scales. The method exploits resonance energy transfer between extracellularly displayed fluorescent proteins targeted to synapses and astrocyte processes. We validated the method in the striatal microcircuitry following in\xa0vivo expression. We determined the proximity of striatal astrocyte processes to distinct neuronal input pathways to D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron synapses and we evaluated how astrocyte-to-excitatory synapse proximity changed following cortical afferent stimulation during ischemia and in a model of Huntingtons disease. NAPA provides a simple approach to measure astrocyte-synapse spatial interactions in a variety of experimental scenarios. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
