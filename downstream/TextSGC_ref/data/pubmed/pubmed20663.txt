Path integration is fundamental to human navigation. When a navigator leaves home on a complex outbound path they are able to keep track of their approximate position and orientation and return to their starting location on a direct homebound path. However there are several sources of error during path integration. Previous research has focused almost exclusively on encoding error-the error in registering the outbound path in memory. Here we also consider execution error-the error in the response such as turning and walking a homebound trajectory. In two experiments conducted in ambulatory virtual environments we examined the contribution of execution error to the rotational component of path integration using angle reproduction tasks. In the reproduction tasks participants rotated once and then rotated again to face the original direction either reproducing the initial turn or turning through the supplementary angle. One outstanding difficulty in disentangling encoding and execution error during a typical angle reproduction task is that as the encoding angle increases so does the required response angle. In Experiment 1 we dissociated these two variables by asking participants to report each encoding angle using two different responses: by turning to walk on a path parallel to the initial facing direction in the same reproduction or opposite supplementary angle direction. In Experiment 2 participants reported the encoding angle by turning both rightward and leftward onto a path parallel to the initial facing direction over a larger range of angles. The results suggest that execution error not encoding error is the predominant source of error in angular path integration. These findings also imply that the path integrator uses an intrinsic action-scaled rather than an extrinsic objective metric.
