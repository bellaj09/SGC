Radiotherapy is a valid treatment option for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However complications can occur following irradiation of the closest anatomical structures including brainstem radionecrosis BRN. The rehabilitation is poorly described in patients with BRN despite its usefulness in improving functional independence in patients with brain tumors. We aimed at testing the usefulness of intensive robot-assisted neurorehabilitation program to improve functional independence in a 57-year-old male with BRN. A case report on intensive robot-assisted rehabilitation program for brainstem radionecrosis.
