In Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM most of the algorithms used to solve problems of syndrome diagnosis are superficial structure algorithms and not considering the cognitive perspective from the brain. However in clinical practice there is complex and nonlinear relationship between symptoms signs and syndrome. So we employed deep leaning and multilabel learning to construct the syndrome diagnostic model for chronic gastritis CG in TCM. The results showed that deep learning could improve the accuracy of syndrome recognition. Moreover the studies will provide a reference for constructing syndrome diagnostic models and guide clinical practice. Deep learning based syndrome diagnosis of chronic gastritis.
