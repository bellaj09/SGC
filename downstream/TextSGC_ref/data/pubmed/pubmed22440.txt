Slow oscillations around 0.1 Hz are characteristic features of both the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Such oscillation have been reported e.g. in blood pressure heart rate EEG and brain oxygenation. Hence conscious intention of a motor act may occur only as a result of brain activity changes in frontal and related brain areas or might be entrained by slow oscillations in the blood pressure. Twenty-six subjects were asked to perform voluntary self-paced at free will brisk finger movements. Some subjects performed self-paced movements in relatively periodic intervals of around 10s at the decreasing slope of the slow 0.1-Hz blood pressure oscillation. Our study reveals the first time that self-paced movements at least in some subjects do not stem from "free will" based on brain activity alone but are influenced by slow blood pressure oscillations. Does conscious intention to perform a motor act depend on slow cardiovascular rhythms?
