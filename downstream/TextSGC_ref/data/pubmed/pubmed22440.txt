Cue reactivity to drug-related stimuli is a frequently observed phenomenon in drug addiction. Cue reactivity refers to a classical conditioned response pattern that occurs when an addicted subject is exposed to drug-related stimuli. This response consists of physiological and cognitive reactions. Craving a subjective desire to use the drug of choice is believed to play an important role in the occurrence of relapse in the natural setting. Besides craving other subjective cue-elicited reactions have been reported including withdrawal symptoms drug-agonistic effects and mood swings. Physiological reactions that have been investigated include skin conductance heart rate salivation and body temperature. Conditioned reactivity to cues is an important factor in addiction to alcohol nicotine opiates and cocaine. Cue exposure treatment CET refers to a manualized repeated exposure to drug-related cues aimed at the reduction of cue reactivity by extinction. In CET different stimuli are presented for example slides video tapes pictures or paraphernalia in nonrealistic experimental settings. Most often assessments consist in subjective ratings by craving scales. Our pilot study will show that immersive virtual reality IVR is as good or even better in eliciting subjective and physiological craving symptoms as classical devices. Immersive virtual environments in cue exposure.
