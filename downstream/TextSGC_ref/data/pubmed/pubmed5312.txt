Imaging equipment is experiencing advances in speed sensitivity safety and workflow. There is an increasing trend toward physiologic imaging and quantitation requiring greater consistency across manufacturers and clinics. The Human Connectome Project is symbolic of the drive toward combining multimodality anatomic and functional imaging with quantitation and sophisticated atlases. Advanced visualization methods have become essential in the evaluation of large multidimensional data sets. Hybrid imaging blends advantages from multiple modalities to provide a comprehensive anatomic functional physiologic and metabolic data set. Breakthrough clinical neuroimaging applications are derived from an alignment of scientific engineering clinical and business conditions. Neuroimaging trends and future outlook.
