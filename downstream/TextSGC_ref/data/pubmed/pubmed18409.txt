Introduction: Classical well-established treatments of social anxiety disorder SAD are now complemented by more recent therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize available therapies for SAD and discuss recent evidence-based findings on the management of this disorder.Areas covered: Recent guidelines recommend psychotherapy particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT and pharmacotherapy as first-line treatments of patients with SAD without a clear superiority of one option over the other. CBT includes classical approaches such as in vivo exposure to social situations and cognitive therapy but new modalities and techniques have been recently developed: third-wave approaches internet-delivered therapy virtual reality exposure and cognitive bias modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have been also extensively studied and shown to be effective in SAD. Two alternative strategies have been developed to treat SAD with disappointing results: cognitive bias modification and pharmacological augmentation of psychotherapy using D-cycloserine during exposure sessions.Expert opinion: Personalized treatments for SAD patients are now available. Innovative strategies such as online psychotherapy and virtual reality exposure are useful alternatives to CBT and SSRIs.
