Representing an intuitive spelling interface for brain-computer interfaces BCI in the auditory domain is not straight-forward. In consequence all existing approaches based on event-related potentials ERP rely at least partially on a visual representation of the interface. This online study introduces an auditory spelling interface that eliminates the necessity for such a visualization. In up to two sessions a group of healthy subjects N\u2009=\u200921 was asked to use a text entry application utilizing the spatial cues of the AMUSE paradigm Auditory Multi-class Spatial ERP. The speller relies on the auditory sense both for stimulation and the core feedback. Without prior BCI experience 76% of the participants were able to write a full sentence during the first session. By exploiting the advantages of a newly introduced dynamic stopping method a maximum writing speed of 1.41\u2009char/min 7.55\u2009bits/min could be reached during the second session average: 0.94\u2009char/min 5.26\u2009bits/min. For the first time the presented work shows that an auditory BCI can reach performances similar to state-of-the-art visual BCIs based on covert attention. These results represent an important step toward a purely auditory BCI. Listen You are Writing! Speeding up Online Spelling with a Dynamic Auditory BCI.
