In this study we propose a deep-learning-based method to correct motion artifacts in optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy OR-PAM. The method is a convolutional neural network that establishes an end-to-end map from input raw data with motion artifacts to output corrected images. First we performed simulation studies to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Second we employed this method to process images of rat brain vessels with multiple motion artifacts to evaluate its performance for in vivo applications. The results demonstrate that this method works well for both large blood vessels and capillary networks. In comparison with traditional methods the proposed method in this study can be easily modified to satisfy different scenarios of motion corrections in OR-PAM by revising the training sets.
