In the last 10 years basic and clinical research in orthopaedics has developed rapidly. Understanding of orthopaedic disorders involves not only routine diagnosis but also the pursuit of highly efficient and accurate three-dimensional imaging of the intra- and extra-medullary distribution form and structure of orthopaedic disorders thus allowing scientific evaluation of the indications for surgery drawing up of the best surgical plan minimization of operative trauma and the earliest possible restoration of limb function. Meanwhile the most important type of basic research which was previously biomechanical research has gradually become computational biomechanics based on in vitro cadaver experiments. This review aims to summarize the research status and application prospects of digital technology in orthopaedics including virtual reality technology reverse engineering and rapid prototyping techniques computational biomechanics computer navigation technology and management of digitization of medical records. Research status and application prospects of digital technology in orthopaedics.
