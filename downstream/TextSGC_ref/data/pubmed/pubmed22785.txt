"This paper considers moments due to friction forces on the human fingertip. A computational technique called the friction moment arc method is presented. The method computes the static and/or dynamic friction moment independent of a friction force calculation. In addition a new finger holder to display friction moment is presented. This device incorporates a small brushless motor and disk and connects the humans finger to an interface finger of the five-fingered haptic interface robot HIRO II. Subjects perception of friction moment while wearing the finger holder as well as perceptions during object manipulation in a virtual reality environment were evaluated experimentally."
