To investigate the potential of conventional and deep learning techniques to recognize the species and distribution of mould in unhulled paddy samples were inoculated and cultivated with five species of mould and sample images were captured. The mould recognition methods were built using support vector machine SVM back-propagation neural network BPNN convolutional neural network CNN and deep belief network DBN models. An accuracy rate of 100% was achieved by using the DBN model to identify the mould species in the sample images based on selected colour-histogram parameters followed by the SVM and BPNN models. A pitch segmentation recognition method combined with different classification models was developed to recognize the mould colony areas in the image. The accuracy rates of the SVM and CNN models for pitch classification were approximately 90% and were higher than those of the BPNN and DBN models. The CNN and DBN models showed quicker calculation speeds for recognizing all of the pitches segmented from a single sample image. Finally an efficient uniform CNN pitch classification model for all five types of sample images was built. This work compares multiple classification models and provides feasible recognition methods for mouldy unhulled paddy recognition.
