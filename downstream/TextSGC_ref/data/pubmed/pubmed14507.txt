With the evolution of technology the fields of medicine and science have also witnessed numerous advancements. In medical emergencies a few minutes can be the difference between life and death. The obstacles encountered while providing medical assistance can be eliminated by ensuring quicker care and accessible systems. To this effect the proposed end-to-end system-automated emergency paramedical response system AEPRS is semi-autonomous and utilizes aerial distribution by drones for providing medical supplies on site in cases of paramedical emergencies as well as for patients with a standing history of diseases. Security of confidential medical information is a major area of concern for patients. Confidentiality has been achieved by using decentralised distributed computing to ensure security for the users without involving third-party institutions. AEPRS focuses not only on urban areas but also on semi-urban and rural areas. In urban areas where access to internet is widely available a healthcare chatbot caters to the individual users and provides a diagnosis based on the symptoms provided by the patients. In semi-urban and rural areas community hospitals have the option of providing specialised healthcare in spite of the absence of a specialised doctor. Additionally object recognition and face recognition by using the concept of edge AI enables deep neural networks to run on the edge without the need for GPU or internet connectivity to connect to the cloud. AEPRS is an airborne emergency medical supply delivery system. It uses the data entered by the user to deduce the best possible solution in case of an alerted emergency situation and responds to the user accordingly.
