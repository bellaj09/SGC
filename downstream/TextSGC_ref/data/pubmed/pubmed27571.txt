The Fifth International Brain-Computer Interface BCI Meeting met June 3-7th 2013 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds Pacific Grove California. The conference included 19 workshops covering topics in brain-computer interface and brain-machine interface research. Topics included translation of BCIs into clinical use standardization and certification types of brain activity to use for BCI recording methods the effects of plasticity special interest topics in BCIs applications and future BCI directions. BCI research is well established and transitioning to practical use to benefit people with physical impairments. At the same time new applications are being explored both for people with physical impairments and beyond. Here we provide summaries of each workshop illustrating the breadth and depth of BCI research and high-lighting important issues for future research and development.
