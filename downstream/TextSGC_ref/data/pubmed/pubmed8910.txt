Quantum Neural Networks QNN models have attracted great attention since it innovates a new neural computing manner based on quantum entanglement. However the existing QNN models are mainly based on the real quantum operations and the potential of quantum entanglement is not fully exploited. In this paper we proposes a novel quantum neuron model called Complex Quantum Neuron CQN that realizes a deep quantum entanglement. Also a novel hybrid networks model Complex Rotation Quantum Dynamic Neural Networks CRQDNN is proposed based on Complex Quantum Neuron CQN. CRQDNN is a three layer model with both CQN and classical neurons. An infinite impulse response IIR filter is embedded in the Networks model to enable the memory function to process time series inputs. The Levenberg-Marquardt LM algorithm is used for fast parameter learning. The networks model is developed to conduct time series predictions. Two application studies are done in this paper including the chaotic time series prediction and electronic remaining useful life RUL prediction.
