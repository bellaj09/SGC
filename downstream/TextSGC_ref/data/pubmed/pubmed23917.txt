Affine-representation-based calibrationfree augmented reality avoids the complicated measurements and calibration of the camera and renders virtual objects without any metric information thus provides better usability over traditional augmented reality systems. However the lack of metric information makes lighting computation impossible. In this paper a novel image-based approach is proposed to simulate the lighting effect on the virtual object. The approach requires a preprocess phase in which the source images are made and in rendering phase the source images are selected according to the camera viewing direction. This approach provides virtual objects rendered under affine-based calibration-free augmented reality systems with a 3-D look and feel and thus will improve the quality of the video output and the user experience under such systems.
