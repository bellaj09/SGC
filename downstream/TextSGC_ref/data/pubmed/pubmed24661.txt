Brain-computer interfaces BCIs make humancomputer interaction more natural especially for people with neuro-muscular disabilities. Among various data acquisition modalities the electroencephalograms EEG occupy the most prominent place due to their non-invasiveness. In this work a method based on sparse kernel machines is proposed for the classification of motor imagery MI EEG data. More specifically a new sparse prior is proposed for the selection of the most important information and the estimation of model parameters is performed using the bayesian framework. The experimental results obtained on a benchmarking EEG dataset for MI have shown that the proposed method compares favorably with state of the art approaches in BCI literature.
