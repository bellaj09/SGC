Macroscopic cortical networks are important for cognitive function but it remains challenging to construct anatomically plausible individual structural connectomes from human neuroimaging. We introduce a new technique for cortical network mapping based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts two human one macaque we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks MSNs have a complex topological organization comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions and greater inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing macaque MSNs with tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was related to axonal connectivity. Finally variation in the degree of human MSN nodes accounted for about\xa040% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric similarity mapping provides a novel robust and biologically plausible approach to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in psychological functions.
