A false sense of reality is a characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum disorders SSD. Reality confusion may also emanate from posterior orbitofrontal cortex OFC lesions as evident in confabulations that patients act upon and disorientation. This confusion can be measured by repeated runs of a continuous recognition task CRT: patients increase their false positive rate from the second run on failing to realize that an item is not a repetition within the current run. Correct handling of these stimuli a faculty called orbitofrontal reality filtering ORFi induces a distinct frontal potential at 200-300\u202fms the "ORFi potential". Patients with schizophrenia have been reported to fail in this task too. Here we explored the electrophysiology of ORFi in SSD. Neural correlates of reality filtering in schizophrenia spectrum disorder.
