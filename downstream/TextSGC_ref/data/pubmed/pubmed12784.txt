Salient object detection is a problem that has been considered in detail and many solutions have been proposed. In this paper we argue that work to date has addressed a problem that is relatively ill-posed. Specifically there is not universal agreement about what constitutes a salient object when multiple observers are queried. This implies that some objects are more likely to be judged salient than others and implies a relative rank exists on salient objects. Initially we present a novel deep learning solution based on a hierarchical representation of relative saliency and stage-wise refinement. Further to this we present data analysis and baseline benchmark results towards addressing the problem of salient object ranking. Methods for deriving suitable ranked salient object instances are presented along with metrics suitable to measuring algorithm performance. In addition we show how a derived dataset can be successively refined to provide cleaned results that correlate well with pristine ground truth in its characteristics and value for training and testing models. Finally we provide a comparison among prevailing algorithms that address salient object ranking or detection to establish initial baselines providing a basis for comparison with future efforts addressing this problem.
