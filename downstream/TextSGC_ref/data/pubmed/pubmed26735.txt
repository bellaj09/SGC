In this pilot study the effect of attention covert and overt on the signal detection and classification of steady-state visual-evoked potential SSVEP were investigated. Using the SSVEP-based paradigm data were acquired from 4 subjects using 3 scalp electroencephalography EEG electrodes located on the visual area. Subjects were instructed to perform the attention task in which they attended covertly or overtly to either of the stimuli flickering with different frequencies 6 7 8 and 9Hz. We observed a decrease in signal power in covert compared to the overt attention. However there was a consistent pattern in covert attention causing an increase in the power of the 2nd harmonic of the attended frequency. Encouraging results of this preliminary study indicates that it can be adapted and implemented in the brain-computer interface BCI system which could potentially be used as a neuro-rehabilitation tool for individuals with attention deficit.
