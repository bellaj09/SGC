Commercially available health monitors rely on rigid electronic housing coupled with aggressive adhesives and conductive gels causing discomfort and inducing skin damage. Also research-level skin-wearable devices while excelling in some aspects fall short as concept-only presentations due to the fundamental challenges of active wireless communication and integration as a single device platform. Here an all-in-one wireless stretchable hybrid electronics with key capabilities for real-time physiological monitoring automatic detection of signal abnormality via deep-learning and a long-range wireless connectivity up to 15 m is introduced. The strategic integration of thin-film electronic layers with hyperelastic elastomers allows the overall device to adhere and deform naturally with the human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. The stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact are capable of generating clinical-grade electrocardiograms and accurate analysis of heart and respiratory rates while the motion sensor assesses physical activities. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time physiological classifications demonstrates the feasibility of multifaceted analysis with a high clinical relevance. Finally in vivo demonstrations with animals and human subjects in various scenarios reveal the versatility of the device as both a health monitor and a viable research tool.
