Although migraine is one of the most investigated neurologic disorders we do not have a perfect neuroimaging biomarker for its pathophysiology. One option to improve our knowledge is to study resting-state functional connectivity in and out of headache pain. However our understanding of the functional connectivity changes during spontaneous migraine attack is partial and incomplete. Spontaneous migraine attack causes alterations in default mode network connectivity: a resting-state fMRI case report.
