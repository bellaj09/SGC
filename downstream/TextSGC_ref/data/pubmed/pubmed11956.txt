Rotating machines are critical equipment in many processes and failures in their operation can have serious implications. Consequently fault detection in rotating machines has been widely investigated. Conventional detection systems include two blocks: feature extraction and classification. These systems are based on manually engineered features ball pass frequencies RMS value kurtosis crest factor etc. and therefore require a high level of human expertise it is a human who designs and selects the most appropriate set of features to perform the classification. Instead we propose a system for condition monitoring and fault detection in rotating machines based on a 1-D deep convolutional neural network 1D DCNN which merges the tasks of feature extraction and classification into a single learning body. The proposed system has been designed for use on a rotating machine with seven possible operating states and it proves to be able to determine the operating condition of the machine almost as accurately as conventional feature-engineered classifiers but without the need for prior knowledge of the machine. The proposed system has also reported good classification on a bearing fault dataset from another machine thus demonstrating its capability to monitor the condition of different machines. Finally the analysis of the features learned by the deep model has revealed valuable and previously unknown machine information such as the rotational speed of the machine or the number of balls in the bearings. In this way our results illustrate not only the good performance of CNNs but also their versatility and the valuable information they could provide about the monitored machine. DCNN for condition monitoring and fault detection in rotating machines and its contribution to the understanding of machine nature.
