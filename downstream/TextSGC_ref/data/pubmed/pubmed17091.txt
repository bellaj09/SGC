"The last 25 years have brought about revolutionary changes for medicine and in particular for urology: internet was only in its infancy medical records were written on paper searches for medical information were done in the hospital library medical articles were photocopied and our relationship with patients only existed face to face. Social networks had not yet appeared and even Google did not exist. Just imagine what might happen during the next 25 years were going to see even more radical changes. The urologist of the future is going to see the arrival of artificial intelligence collaborative medicine telemedicine machine learning the Internet of Things and personalized robotics; in the meantime social media will continue to transform the interaction between physician and patient. The training of urologists will also be different thanks to new learning technologies such as virtual reality or augmented reality. IBM Watson Health through its system of artificial intelligence and its learning algorithms will become our essential travel companion. The urologist of the future as well as physician will have to acquire the necessary technological skills in order to use all these new tools which are already on the horizon."
