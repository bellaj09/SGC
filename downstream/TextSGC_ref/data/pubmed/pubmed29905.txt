The present case study looked into the feasibility of using brain-computer interface BCI technology combined with computer-supported cooperative work CSCW in a wireless network. We had two objectives; first to test the wireless BCI-based configuration and the practical use of this idea we assessed workload perception in participants located several kilometers apart taking part in the same drawing task. Second we studied the cortical activation patterns of participants performing the drawing task with and without the BCI technology. Results showed higher mental workload perception and broader cortical activation frontal-temporal-occipital under BCI experimental conditions. This idea shows a possible application of BCI research in the social field where two or more users could engage in a computer networking task using BCI technology over the internet. New research avenues for CSCW are discussed and possibilities for future research are given. Wireless Computer-Supported Cooperative Work: A Pilot Experiment on Art and BrainComputer Interfaces.
