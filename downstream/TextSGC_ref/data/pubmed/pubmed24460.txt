Recent studies comparing inexpensive low-fidelity box trainers to expensive computer-based virtual reality systems demonstrate similar acquisition of surgical skills and transferability to the clinical setting. With new mandates emerging that all surgical residency programs have access to a surgical skills laboratory we describe our cost-effective approach to teaching basic and advanced open and laparoscopic skills utilizing inexpensive bench models box trainers and animate models. A cost-effective approach to establishing a surgical skills laboratory.
