There is a substantial literature on the neurobiology of reading and dyslexia. Differences are often described in terms of individual regions or individual cognitive processes. However there is a growing appreciation that the brain areas subserving reading are nested within larger functional systems and new network analysis methods may provide greater insight into how reading difficulty arises. Yet relatively few studies have adopted a principled network-based approach e.g. connectomics to studying reading. In this study we combine data from previous reading literature connectomics studies and original data to investigate the relationship between network architecture and reading. Applying a network framework to the neurobiology of reading and dyslexia.
