Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD is characterized by remarkable heterogeneity in social communication and behavioral deficits creating a major barrier in identifying effective treatments for a given individual with ASD. To facilitate precision medicine in ASD we utilized a well-validated biological motion neuroimaging task to identify pretreatment biomarkers that can accurately forecast the response to an evidence-based behavioral treatment Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training VR-SCT. In a preliminary sample of 17 young adults with high-functioning ASD we identified neural predictors of change in emotion recognition after VR-SCT. The predictors were characterized by the pretreatment brain activations to biological vs. scrambled motion in the neural circuits that support a language comprehension and interpretation of incongruent auditory emotions and prosody and b processing socio-emotional experience and interpersonal affective information as well as emotional regulation. The predictive value of the findings for individual adults with ASD was supported by regression-based multivariate pattern analyses with cross validation. To our knowledge this is the first pilot study that shows neuroimaging-based predictive biomarkers for treatment effectiveness in adults with ASD. The findings have potentially far-reaching implications for developing more precise and effective treatments for ASD.
