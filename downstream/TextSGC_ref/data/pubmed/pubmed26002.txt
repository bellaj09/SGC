"The Virtual Tape Measure for the Operating Microscope VTMOM was created to assist surgeons in making accurate 3D measurements of anatomical structures seen in the surgical field under the operating microscope. The VTMOM employs augmented reality techniques by combining stereoscopic video images with stereoscopic computer graphics and functions by relying on an operators ability to align a 3D graphic pointer which serves as the end-point of the virtual tape measure with designated locations on the anatomical structure being measured. The VTMOM was evaluated for its baseline and application performances as well as its application efficacy."
