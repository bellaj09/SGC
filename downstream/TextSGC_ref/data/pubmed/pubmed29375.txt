The modulation of perturbation-evoked potential PEP N1 as a function of different biomechanical characteristics of perturbation has been investigated before. However it remains unknown whether the PEP N1 modulation contributes to the shaping of the functional postural response. To improve this understanding we examined the modulation of functional postural response in relation to the PEP N1 response in ten healthy young subjects during unpredictable perturbations to their upright stance-translations of the support surface in a forward or backward direction at two different amplitudes of constant speed. Using independent components from the fronto-central region obtained from subject-specific head models created from the MRI our results show that the latency of onset of the functional postural response after the PEP N1 response was faster for forward than backward perturbations at a constant speed but was not affected by the speed of perturbation. Further our results reinforce some of the previous findings that suggested that the N1 peak amplitude and peak latency are both modulated by the speed of perturbation but not by the direction of the perturbation. Our results improve the understanding of the relation between characteristics of perturbation and the neurophysiology of reactive balance control and may have implications for the design of brain-machine interfaces for populations with a higher risk of falls.
