"Virtual Reality is used in various ways for creating a storytelling experience. It gives us the opportunity to imagine ones life events as a story and in settings that are intended to aid the self such as treatment of trauma anxiety phobia etc. This paper discusses the ways that challenging experiences change the way people perceive their life narratives and form their memories. This paper suggests that virtual reality VR can be used for the exploration of alternative scenarios in order to see ones overall line of life in a new and healthier way. Considering the theoretical background of the narrative self this research proposes a novel view of VR immersion as a medium for constructing a new storyline and attitude to the past. The approach would also influence attitudes regarding the present and future and thus better shape the narrative of the self which can lead to healthier life experiences."
