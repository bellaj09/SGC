In-silico bitterant prediction received the considerable attention due to the expensive and laborious experimental-screening of the bitterant. In this work we collect the fully experimental dataset containing 707 bitterants and 592 non-bitterants which is distinct from the fully or partially hypothetical non-bitterant dataset used in the previous works. Based on this experimental dataset we harness the consensus votes from the multiple machine-learning methods e.g. deep learning etc. combined with the molecular fingerprint to build the bitter/bitterless classification models with five-fold cross-validation which are further inspected by the Y-randomization test and applicability domain analysis. One of the best consensus models affords the accuracy precision specificity sensitivity F1-score and Matthews correlation coefficient MCC of 0.929 0.918 0.898 0.954 0.936 and 0.856 respectively on our test set. For the automatic prediction of bitterant a graphic program "e-Bitter" is developed for the convenience of users via the simple mouse click. To our best knowledge it is for the first time to adopt the consensus model for the bitterant prediction and develop the first free stand-alone software for the experimental food scientist. e-Bitter: Bitterant Prediction by the Consensus Voting From the Machine-Learning Methods.
