The thalamus is a highly connected subcortical structure that relays and integrates sensory and cortical information which is critical for coherent and accurate perceptual awareness and cognition. Thalamic dysfunction is a classical finding in schizophrenia SZ and resting-state functional MRI has implicated somatomotor and frontal lobe thalamic dysconnectivity. However it remains unclear whether these findings generalize to different psychotic disorders are confined to specific thalamic sub-regions and how they relate to structural thalamic alterations. Within-thalamic and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was assessed using resting-state functional MRI data obtained from patients with SZ n\xa0=\xa096 bipolar disorder BD n\xa0=\xa057 and healthy controls HC n\xa0=\xa0280. Further we used thalamic sub-regions as seeds to investigate specific cortical connectivity patterns and performed structural analyses of thalamic volume and shape. Results showed reduced within-thalamic connectivity and thalamo-frontoparietal coupling in SZ and increased thalamo-somatomotor connectivity in BD. One thalamic sub-region showed increased sensory connectivity in SZ and eight sub-regions showed reductions with frontal and posterior areas. Reduced gray matter and shape abnormalities were found in frontal-projecting regions in both SZ and BD but did not seem to explain reduced functional connectivity. Aberrant thalamo-cortical connectivity patterns in SZ and BD supports the notion of the thalamus as a key structure in the functional connectome across the psychosis spectrum and the frontal and somatomotor anatomical distribution is in line with the characteristic cognitive and perceptual symptoms in psychotic disorders.
