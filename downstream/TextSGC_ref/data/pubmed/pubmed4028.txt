The middle longitudinal fasciculus MdLF is a small and somewhat controversial white matter tract of the human cerebrum confined to the posterior superior temporal region from which it courses posteriorly to connect at the occipital-parietal interface. The tract appears to be involved in language processing as well as auditory organization and localization while sub-serving other higher level cognitive functions that have yet to be fully elucidated. Little is known about the specific interparcellation connections that integrate to form the MdLF. Utilizing diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging tractography coupled with the human cortex parcellation data presented earlier in this supplement we aim to describe the macro-connectome of the MdLF in relation to the linked parcellations present within the human cortex. The purpose of this study is to present this information in an indexed illustrated and tractographically aided series of figures and tables for anatomic and clinical reference.
