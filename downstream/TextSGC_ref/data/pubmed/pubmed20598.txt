Impairments in cervical kinematics are common in patients with neck pain. A virtual reality VR device has potential to be effective in the management of these impairments. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of kinematic training KT with and without the use of an interactive VR device. In this assessor-blinded allocation-concealed pilot clinical trial 32 participants with chronic neck pain were randomised into the KT or kinematic plus VR training KTVR group. Both groups completed four to six training sessions comprising of similar KT activities such as active and quick head movements and fine head movement control and stability over five weeks. Only the KTVR group used the VR device. The primary outcome measures were neck disability index NDI cervical range of motion ROM head movement velocity and accuracy. Kinematic measures were collected using the VR system that was also used for training. Secondary measures included pain intensity TAMPA scale of kinesiophobia static and dynamic balance global perceived effect and participant satisfaction. The results demonstrated significant p < 0.05 improvements in NDI ROM rotation velocity and the step test in both groups post-intervention. At 3-month post-intervention these improvements were mostly sustained; however there was no control group which limits the interpretation of this. Between-group analysis showed a few specific differences including global perceived change that was greater in the KTVR group. This pilot study has provided directions and justification for future research exploring training using kinematic training and VR for those with neck pain in a larger cohort.
