Sensorimotor rhythms SMR 8-15 Hz are brain oscillations associated with successful motor performance imagery and imitation. Voluntary modulation of SMR can be used to control brain-machine interfaces BMI in the absence of any physical movements. The mechanisms underlying acquisition of such skill are unknown. Here we provide evidence for a causal link between function of the primary motor cortex M1 active during motor skill learning and retention and successful acquisition of abstract skills such as control over SMR. Thirty healthy participants were trained on 5 consecutive days to control SMR oscillations. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of 3 groups that received either 20 min of anodal cathodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS over M1. Learning SMR control across training days was superior in the anodal tDCS group relative to the other 2. Cathodal tDCS blocked the beneficial effects of training as evidenced with sham tDCS. One month later the newly acquired skill remained superior in the anodal tDCS group. Thus application of weak electric currents of opposite polarities over M1 differentially modulates learning SMR control pointing to this primary cortical region as a common substrate for acquisition of physical motor skills and learning to control brain oscillatory activity.
