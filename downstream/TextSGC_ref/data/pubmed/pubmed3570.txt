Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically our analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography iEEG recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable "degenerate" and this phase is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2 sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control. Degenerate time-dependent network dynamics anticipate seizures in human epileptic brain.
