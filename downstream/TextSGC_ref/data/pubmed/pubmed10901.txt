Inspired by spiders that can generate and sense vibrations to obtain information regarding a substrate we propose an intelligent system that can recognize the type of surface being touched by knocking the surface and listening to the vibrations. Hence we developed a system that is equipped with an electromagnetic hammer for hitting the ground and an accelerometer for measuring the mechanical responses induced by the impact. We investigate the feasibility of sensing 10 different daily surfaces through various machine-learning techniques including recent deep-learning approaches. Although some test surfaces are similar experimental results show that our system can recognize 10 different surfaces remarkably well test accuracy of 98.66%. In addition our results without directly hitting the surface internal impact exhibited considerably high test accuracy 97.51%. Finally we conclude this paper with the limitations and future directions of the study. Knocking and Listening: Learning Mechanical Impulse Response for Understanding Surface Characteristics.
