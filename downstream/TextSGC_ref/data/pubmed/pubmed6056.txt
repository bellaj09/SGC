Stress-induced changes in functional brain connectivity have been linked to the etiology of stress-related disorders. Resting state functional connectivity rsFC is especially informative in characterizing the temporal trajectory of glucocorticoids during stress adaptation. Using the imaging Maastricht Acute Stress Test iMAST we induced acute stress in 39 healthy volunteers and monitored the neuroendocrine stress levels during three runs of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI: before run 1 immediately following run 2 and 30 min after acute stress run 3. The iMAST resulted in strong increases in cortisol levels. Whole-brain analysis revealed that acute stress run 2 - 1 was characterized by changes in connectivity of the amygdala with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex vlPFC ventral posterior cingulate cortex PCC cuneus parahippocampal gyrus and culmen. Additionally cortisol responders were characterized by enhanced amygdala - medial prefrontal cortex mPFC connectivity. Stress recovery run 3 - 2 was characterized by altered amygdala connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlPFC ventral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ACC anterior hippocampal complex cuneus and presupplementary motor area preSMA. Opposite to non-responders cortisol responders were characterized by enhanced amygdala connectivity with the anterior hippocampal complex and parahippocampal gyrus and reduced connectivity with left dlPFC dACC and culmen during early recovery. Acute stress responding and recovery are thus associated with changes in the functional connectivity of the amygdala network. Our findings show that these changes may be regulated via stress-induced neuroendocrine levels. Defining stress-induced neuronal network changes is pertinent to developing treatments that target abnormal neuronal activity.
