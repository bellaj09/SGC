"The authors confirmed E. Z. Rothkopf and M. L. Dashens 1995 finding that specific problem context such as thematic surface features forms associative connections with deep problem features and thus speeds particular decisions particularization. In 5 experiments using a 3-bit decision task and pre-memorized decision rules the authors found that the ability of a situational context to reinstate was decreased by its replacement by another modal surface context. Context reinstatement as measured by decision speed depended on both global and recent local densities of specific problem features linked to a particular decision. The authors results are consistent with J. R. Anderson and L. J. Schoolers 1991 needs/odds analysis and suggest a push-down file model for diverse context influences as a mechanism for responding to changing situational demands."
