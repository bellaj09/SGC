This paper aimed to develop a novel electromyography EMG-based neural-machine interface NMI that is user-generic for continuously predicting coordinated motion betweenmuscle contractionmetacarpophalangeal MCP and wrist flexion/extension. The NMI requires a minimum calibration procedure that only involves capturing maximal voluntary muscle contraction for themonitoredmuscles for individual users. At the center of the NMI is a user-generic musculoskeletal model based on the experimental data collected from six able-bodied AB subjects and nine different upper limb postures. The generic model was evaluated on-line on both AB subjects and a transradial amputee. The subjectswere instructed to performa virtual hand/wrist posture matching task with different upper limb postures. The on-line performanceof the genericmodelwas also compared with that of the musculoskeletal model customized to each individual user called "specific model". All subjects accomplished the assigned virtual tasks while using the user-generic NMI although the AB subjects produced better performance than the amputee subject. Interestingly compared with the specific model the generic model produced comparable completion time a reduced number of overshoots and improved path efficiency in the virtual hand/wrist posture matching task. The results suggested that it is possible to design an EMG-driven NMI based on a musculoskeletalmodelthat could fit multiple users including upper limb amputees for predicting coordinated MCP and wrist motion. The present new method might address the challenges of existing advanced EMG-based NMI that require frequent and lengthy customization and calibration. Our future research will focus on evaluating the developed NMI for powered prosthetic arms. Myoelectric Control Based on a Generic Musculoskeletal Model: Toward a Multi-User Neural-Machine Interface.
