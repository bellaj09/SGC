In recent years wireless-based fingerprint positioning has attracted increasing research attention owing to its position-related features and applications in the Internet of Things IoT. In this paper by leveraging long-term evolution LTE signals a novel deep-learning-based fingerprint positioning approach is proposed to solve the problem of outdoor positioning. Considering the outstanding performance of deep learning in image classification LTE signal measurements are converted into location grayscale images to form a fingerprint database. In order to deal with the instability of LTE signals prevent the gradient dispersion problem and increase the robustness of the proposed deep neural network DNN the following methods are adopted: First cross-entropy is used as the loss function of the DNN. Second the learning rate of the proposed DNN is dynamically adjusted. Third this paper adopted several data enhancement techniques. To find the best positioning fingerprint and method three types of fingerprint and five positioning models are compared. Finally by using a deep residual network Resnet and transfer learning a hierarchical structure training method is proposed. The proposed Resnet is used to train with the united fingerprint image database to obtain a positioning model called a coarse localizer. By using the prior knowledge of the pretrained Resnet feed-forward neural network FFNN-based transfer learning is used to train with the united fingerprint database to obtain a better positioning model called a fine localizer. The experimental results convincingly show that the proposed DNN can automatically learn the location features of LTE signals and achieve satisfactory positioning accuracy in outdoor environments.
