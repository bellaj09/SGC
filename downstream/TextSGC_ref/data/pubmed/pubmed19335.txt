Considering the emerging advantages related to virtual reality implementation in clinical rehabilitation the aim of the present study was to discover possible i improvements achievable in unilateral vestibular hypofunction patients using a self-assessed head-mounted device HMD-based gaming procedure when combined with a classical vestibular rehabilitation protocol HMD group as compared with a group undergoing only vestibular rehabilitation and ii HMD procedure-related side effects. Therefore 24 vestibular rehabilitation and 23-matched HMD unilateral vestibular hypofunction individuals simultaneously underwent a 4-week rehabilitation protocol. Both otoneurological measures vestibulo-ocular reflex gain and postural arrangement by studying both posturography parameters and spectral values of body oscillation and performance and self-report measures Italian Dizziness Handicap Inventory; Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale; Zung Instrument for Anxiety Disorders Dynamic Gait Index; and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire were analyzed by means of a between-group/within-subject analysis of variance model. A significant post-treatment between-effect was found and the HMD group demonstrated an overall improvement in vestibulo-ocular reflex gain on the lesional side in posturography parameters in low-frequency spectral domain as well as in Italian Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale scores. Meanwhile Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms related to experimental home-based gaming tasks during the HMD procedure. Our findings revealed the possible advantages of HMD implementation in vestibular rehabilitation suggesting it as an innovative self-assessed low-cost and compliant tool useful in maximizing vestibular rehabilitation outcomes. Three-dimensional head-mounted gaming task procedure maximizes effects of vestibular rehabilitation in unilateral vestibular hypofunction: a randomized controlled pilot trial.
