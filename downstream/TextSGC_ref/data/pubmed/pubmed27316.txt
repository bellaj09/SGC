Implementing a complex spelling program using a steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI remains a challenge due to difficulties in stimulus presentation and target identification. This study aims to explore the feasibility of mixed frequency and phase coding in building a high-speed SSVEP speller with a computer monitor. A frequency and phase approximation approach was developed to eliminate the limitation of the number of targets caused by the monitor refresh rate resulting in a speller comprising 32 flickers specified by eight frequencies 8-15 Hz with a 1 Hz interval and four phases 0 90 180 and 270. A multi-channel approach incorporating Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA and SSVEP training data was proposed for target identification. In a simulated online experiment at a spelling rate of 40 characters per minute the system obtained an averaged information transfer rate ITR of 166.91 bits/min across 13 subjects with a maximum individual ITR of 192.26 bits/min the highest ITR ever reported in electroencephalogram EEG-based BCIs. The results of this study demonstrate great potential of a high-speed SSVEP-based BCI in real-life applications. A high-speed brain speller using steady-state visual evoked potentials.
