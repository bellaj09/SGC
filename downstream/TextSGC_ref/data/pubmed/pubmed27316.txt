Event-related potentials ERPs especially P300 are popular effective features for brain-computer interface BCI systems based on electroencephalography EEG. Traditional ERP-based BCI systems may perform poorly for small training samples i.e. the undersampling problem. In this study the ERP classification problem was investigated in particular the ERP classification in the high-dimensional setting with the number of features larger than the number of samples was studied. A flexible group sparse discriminative analysis algorithm based on Moreau-Yosida regularization was proposed for alleviating the undersampling problem. An optimization problem with the group sparse criterion was presented and the optimal solution was proposed by using the regularized optimal scoring method. During the alternating iteration procedure the feature selection and classification were performed simultaneously. Two P300-based BCI datasets were used to evaluate our proposed new method and compare it with existing standard methods. The experimental results indicated that the features extracted via our proposed method are efficient and provide an overall better P300 classification accuracy compared with several state-of-the-art methods.
