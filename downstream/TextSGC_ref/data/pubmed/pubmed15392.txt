Diagnosis of lung cancer requires radiologists to review every lung nodule in CT images. Such a process can be very time-consuming and the accuracy is affected by many factors such as experience of radiologists and available diagnosis time. To address this problem we proposed to develop a deep learning-based system to automatically classify benign and malignant lung nodules. A manifold learning regularization approach to enhance 3D CT image-based lung nodule classification.
