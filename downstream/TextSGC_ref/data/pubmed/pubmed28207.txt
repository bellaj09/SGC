We propose and test a novel brain-computer interface BCI based on imagined tactile sensation. During an imagined tactile sensation referred to as somatosensory attentional orientation SAO the subject shifts and maintains somatosensory attention on a body part e.g. left or right hand. The SAO can be detected from EEG recordings for establishing a communication channel. To test for the hypothesis that SAO on different body parts can be discriminated from EEG 14 subjects were assigned to a group who received an actual sensory stimulation STE-Group and 18 subjects were assigned to the SAO only group SAO-Group. In single trials the STE-Group received tactile stimulation first both wrists simultaneously stimulated and then maintained the attention on the selected body part without stimulation. The same group also performed the SAO task first and then received the tactile stimulation. Conversely the SAO-Group performed SAO without any stimulation neither before nor after the SAO. In both the STE-Group and SAO-Group it was possible to identify the SAO-related oscillatory activation that corresponded to a contralateral event-related desynchronization ERD stronger than the ipsilateral ERD. Discriminative information represented as R2  was found mainly on the somatosensory area of the cortex. In the STE-Group the average classification accuracy of SAO was 83.6% and it was comparable with tactile BCI based on selective sensation paired-t test P > 0.05 . In the SAO-Group the average online performance was 75.7%. For this group after frequency band selection the offline performance reached 82.5% on average with  80% for 12 subjects and  95% for four subjects. Complementary to tactile sensation the SAO does not require sensory stimulation with the advantage of being completely independent from the stimulus.
