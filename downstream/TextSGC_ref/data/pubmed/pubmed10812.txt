Background Renal impairment is common in patients with coronary artery disease and if severe late gadolinium enhancement LGE imaging for myocardial infarction MI evaluation cannot be performed. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework for chronic MI delineation via deep learning on non-contrast material-enhanced cardiac cine MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center study a deep learning model was developed to extract motion features from the left ventricle and delineate MI regions on nonenhanced cardiac cine MRI collected between October 2015 and March 2017. Patients with chronic MI as well as healthy control patients had both nonenhanced cardiac cine 25 phases per cardiac cycle and LGE MRI examinations. Eighty percent of MRI examinations were used for the training data set and 20% for the independent testing data set. Chronic MI regions on LGE MRI were defined as ground truth. Diagnostic performance was assessed by analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC. MI area and MI area percentage from nonenhanced cardiac cine and LGE MRI were compared by using the Pearson correlation paired t test and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Study participants included 212 patients with chronic MI men 171; age 57.2 years  12.5 and 87 healthy control patients men 42; age 43.3 years  15.5. Using the full cardiac cine MRI the per-segment sensitivity and specificity for detecting chronic MI in the independent test set was 89.8% and 99.1% respectively with an AUC of 0.94. There were no differences between nonenhanced cardiac cine and LGE MRI analyses in number of MI segments 114 vs 127 respectively; P = .38 per-patient MI area 6.2 cm2  2.8 vs 5.5 cm2  2.3 respectively; P = .27; correlation coefficient r = 0.88 and MI area percentage 21.5%  17.3 vs 18.5%  15.4; P = .17; correlation coefficient r = 0.89. Conclusion The proposed deep learning framework on nonenhanced cardiac cine MRI enables the confirmation presence detection position and delineation transmurality and size of chronic myocardial infarction. However future larger-scale multicenter studies are required for a full validation. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Online supplemental material is available for this article.
