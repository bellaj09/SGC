The majority of the current surgical simulators employ specialized sensory equipment for instrument tracking. The Leap Motion controller is a new device able to track linear objects with sub-millimeter accuracy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a virtual reality VR simulator for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills based on the low-cost Leap Motion controller. Virtual reality-based assessment of basic laparoscopic skills using the Leap Motion controller.
