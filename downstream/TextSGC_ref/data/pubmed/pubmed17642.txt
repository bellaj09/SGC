As the population ages the prevention of falls is an increasingly important public health problem. Balance assessment forms an important component of fall-prevention programs for older adults. The recent development of cost-effective and highly responsive virtual reality VR systems means new methods of balance assessment are feasible in a clinical setting. This proof-of-concept study made use of the submillimeter tracking built into modern VR head-mounted displays VRHMDs to assess balance through the use of visual-vestibular conflict. The objective of this study was to evaluate the validity acceptability and reliability of using a VRHMD to assess balance in older adults. Assessing balance through the use of a low-cost head-mounted display in older adults: a pilot study.
