High resolution and high throughput genotype to phenotype studies in plants are underway to accelerate breeding of climate ready crops. In the recent years deep learning techniques and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Short Term Memories LSTMs have shown great success in visual data recognition classification and sequence learning tasks. More recently CNNs have been used for plant classification and phenotyping using individual static images of the plants. On the other hand dynamic behavior of the plants as well as their growth has been an important phenotype for plant biologists and this motivated us to study the potential of LSTMs in encoding these temporal information for the accession classification task which is useful in automation of plant production and care.
