Error-related negativity ERN is a signal that is associated with error detection. Joch and colleagues Joch M Hegele M Maurer H Mller H Maurer LK. J Neurophysiol 118: 486-495 2017 successfully separated the ERN as a response to online prediction error from feedback updates. We discuss the role of ERN in action and suggest insights from virtual reality techniques; we consider the potential benefit of self-evaluation in determining the mechanisms of ERN amplitude; finally we review the oscillatory activity that has been claimed to accompany ERN. Predictive monitoring of actions EEG recordings in virtual reality.
