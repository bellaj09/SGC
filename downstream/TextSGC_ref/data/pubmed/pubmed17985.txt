"Surgery interventional radiology and advanced endoscopy have all developed minimally invasive techniques to effectively treat a variety of diseases with positive impact on patients postoperative outcomes. However those techniques are challenging and require extensive training. Robotics and computer sciences can help facilitate minimally invasive approaches. Furthermore surgery advanced endoscopy and interventional radiology could converge towards a new hybrid specialty hybrid image-guided minimally invasive therapies in which the three fundamental disciplines could complement one another to maximize the positive effects and reduce the iatrogenic footprint on patients. The present manuscript describes the fundamental steps of this new paradigm shift in surgical therapies that in our opinion will be the next revolutionary step in minimally invasive approaches." Next step in minimally invasive surgery: hybrid image-guided surgery.
