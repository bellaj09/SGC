With challenges in understanding the multifactorial etiologies of disease and individual treatment effect heterogeneities over the past four decades much has been acquired on how physical chemical and social environments affect human health predisposing certain subpopulations to adverse health outcomes especially the socio-environmentally disadvantaged SED. Current translational data on gene and adverse environment interaction have revealed how adverse gene-environment interaction termed aberrant epigenomic modulation translates into impaired gene expression via messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA dysregulation reflecting abnormal protein synthesis and hence dysfunctional cellular differentiation and maturation. The environmental influence on gene expression observed in most literature includes physical chemical physicochemical and recently social environment. However data are limited on spiritual or religious environment network support systems which reflect human psychosocial conditions and gene interaction. With this limited information we aimed to examine the available data on spiritual activities characterized by prayers and meditation for a possible explanation of the nexus between the spiritual network support system SNSS as a component of psychosocial conditions implicated in social signal transduction and the gene expression correlate. With the intent to incorporate SNSS in human psychosocial conditions we assessed the available data on bereavement loss of spouse loneliness social isolation low socio-economic status SES chronic stress low social status social adversity SA and early life stress ELS as surrogates for spiritual support network connectome. Adverse human psychosocial conditions have the tendency for impaired gene expression through an up-regulated conserved transcriptional response to adversity CTRA gene expression via social signal transduction involving the sympathetic nervous system SNS beta-adrenergic receptors the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis and the glucocorticoid response. This review specifically explored CTRA gene expression and the nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 NR3C1 gene a glucocorticoid receptor gene in response to stress and the impaired negative feedback given allostatic overload as a result of prolonged and sustained stress and social isolation as well as the implied social interaction associated with religiosity. While more remains to be investigated on psychosocial and immune cell response and gene expression current data on human models do implicate appropriate gene expression via the CTRA and NR3C1 gene in the SNSS as observed in meditation yoga and thai-chi implicated in malignant neoplasm remission. However prospective epigenomic studies in this context are required in the disease causal pathway prognosis and survival as well as cautious optimism in the application of these findings in clinical and public health settings due to unmeasured and potential confoundings implicated in these correlations.
