Prostate segmentation in Magnetic Resonance MR Images is a significant yet challenging task for prostate cancer treatment. Most of the existing works attempted to design a global classifier for all MR images which neglect the discrepancy of images across different patients. To this end we propose a novel transfer approach for prostate segmentation in MR images. Firstly an image-specific classifier is built for each training image. Secondly a pair of dictionaries and a mapping matrix are jointly obtained by a novel Semi-Coupled Dictionary Transfer Learning SCDTL. Finally the classifiers on the source domain could be selectively transferred to the target domain i.e. testing images by the dictionaries and the mapping matrix. The evaluation demonstrates that our approach has a competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. Moreover the proposed transfer approach outperforms the conventional deep neural network based method. A NOVEL IMAGE-SPECIFIC TRANSFER APPROACH FOR PROSTATE SEGMENTATION IN MR IMAGES.
