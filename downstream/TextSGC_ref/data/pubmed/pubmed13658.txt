The gap between predicted brain age using magnetic resonance imaging MRI and chronological age may serve as a biomarker for early-stage neurodegeneration. However owing to the lack of large longitudinal studies it has been challenging to validate this link. We aimed to investigate the utility of such a gap as a risk biomarker for incident dementia using a deep learning approach for predicting brain age based on MRI-derived gray matter GM. We built a convolutional neural network CNN model to predict brain age trained on 3688 dementia-free participants of the Rotterdam Study mean age 66  11 y 55% women. Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards were used to assess the association of the age gap with incident dementia adjusted for age sex intracranial volume GM volume hippocampal volume white matter hyperintensities years of education and APOE 4 allele carriership. Additionally we computed the attention maps which shows which regions are important for age prediction. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models showed that the age gap was significantly related to incident dementia odds ratio OR = 1.11 and 95% confidence intervals CI = 1.05-1.16; hazard ratio HR = 1.11 and 95% CI = 1.06-1.15 respectively. Attention maps indicated that GM density around the amygdala and hippocampi primarily drove the age estimation. We showed that the gap between predicted and chronological brain age is a biomarker complimentary to those that are known associated with risk of dementia and could possibly be used for early-stage dementia risk screening.
