 Electrocorticography ECoG has been used for a range of applications including electrophysiological mapping epilepsy monitoring and more recently as a recording modality for brain-computer interfaces BCIs. Studies that examine ECoG electrodes designed and implanted chronically solely for BCI applications remain limited. The present study explored how two key factors influence chronic closed-loop ECoG BCI: i the effect of inter-electrode distance on BCI performance and ii the differences in neural adaptation and performance when fixed versus adaptive BCI decoding weights are used. Spatial co-adaptation of cortical control columns in a micro-ECoG brain-computer interface.
