"Diffusion imaging abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia SZ and bipolar disorder BD indicating impaired structural connectivity. Newer methods permit the automated reconstruction of major white matter tracts from diffusion-weighted MR images in each individuals native space. Using high-definition diffusion data from SZ and BP subjects we investigated brain white matter integrity using both an automated tract-based and voxel-based methods."
