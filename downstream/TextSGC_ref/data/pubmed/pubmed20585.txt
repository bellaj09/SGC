The identification of the intentionality of movement is a key-aspect for the development of brain-computer interfaces BCIs applicable to daily life in neurological patients. We present a novel method of processing of electroencephalography EEG signals for the extraction of movement intention in neurological patients with upper limb tremor. This method is based on event-related EEG desynchronization considering  8-12 Hz  13-30 Hz and  30-40 Hz bands. We have analyzed the EEG signals from the sensorimotor areas of 4 neurological patients presenting an upper limb tremor grade 1 to 3/4 and executing successive finger-to-nose movements. A Quality Parameter QP for the detection of intentionality of movement has been extracted by considering: a the changes in the / and / ratio representing bursts of - frequencies during the pre-movement period; b an appropriate threshold predicting the movement; c the number of movements executed. This QP allows the prediction of the voluntary movement with a probability between 70% and 90%. This method could be implemented in a wearable BCI to detect the intentionality of movement and could be used for instance to trigger the electrical stimulation in selected muscles of upper limbs with the aim of blocking the emergence of tremor.
