Learning the deep structures and unknown correlations is important for the detection of motor imagery of EEG signals MI-EEG. This study investigates the use of convolutional neural networks CNNs for the classification of multi-class MI-EEG signals. Augmented common spatial pattern ACSP features are generated based on pair-wise projection matrices which covers various frequency ranges. We propose a frequency complementary feature map selection FCMS scheme by constraining the dependency among frequency bands. Experiments are conducted on BCI competition IV dataset IIa with 9 subjects. Averaged cross-validation accuracy of 68.45% and 69.27% is achieved for FCMS and all feature maps respectively which is significantly higher 4.53% and 5.34% than random map selection and higher 1.44% and 2.26% than filter-bank CSP FBCSP. The results demonstrate that the CNNs are capable of learning discriminant deep structure features for EEG classification without relying on the handcrafted features. On the use of convolutional neural networks and augmented CSP features for multi-class motor imagery of EEG signals classification.
