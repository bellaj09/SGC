Electromagnetic stimulation of the human brain is a key tool for neurophysiological characterization and the diagnosis of several neurological disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS is a commonly used clinical procedure. However personalized TMS requires a pipeline for individual head model generation to provide target-specific stimulation. This process includes intensive segmentation of several head tissues based on magnetic resonance imaging MRI which has significant potential for segmentation error especially for low-contrast tissues. Additionally a uniform electrical conductivity is assigned to each tissue in the model which is an unrealistic assumption based on conventional volume conductor modeling. This study proposes a novel approach for fast and automatic estimation of the electric conductivity in the human head for volume conductor models without anatomical segmentation. A convolutional neural network is designed to estimate personalized electrical conductivity values based on anatomical information obtained from T1- and T2- weighted MRI scans. This approach can avoid the time-consuming process of tissue segmentation and maximize the advantages of position-dependent conductivity assignment based on the water content values estimated from MRI intensity values. The computational results of the proposed approach provide similar but smoother electric field distributions of the brain than that provided by conventional approaches.
