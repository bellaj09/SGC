Presently most deaths are caused by heart disease. To overcome this situation heartbeat sound analysis is a convenient way to diagnose heart disease. Heartbeat sound classification is still a challenging problem in heart sound segmentation and feature extraction. Dataset-B applied in this study that contains three categories Normal Murmur and Extra-systole heartbeat sound. In the purposed framework we remove the noise from the heartbeat sound signal by applying the band filter After that we fixed the size of the sampling rate of each sound signal. Then we applied down-sampling techniques to get more discriminant features and reduce the dimension of the frame rate. However it does not affect the results and also decreases the computational power and time. Then we applied a purposed model Recurrent Neural Network RNN that is based on Long Short-Term Memory LSTM Dropout Dense and Softmax layer. As a result the purposed method is more competitive compared to other methods. Heartbeat Sound Signal Classification Using Deep Learning.
