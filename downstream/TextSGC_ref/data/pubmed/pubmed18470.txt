Nowadays kidney cancer surgery has been focusing on a patient-tailored management expanding the indication to nephron-sparing surgery NSS. Starting from computer tomography images 3D models can be created allowing a never experienced before understanding of surgical anatomy. Once obtained the models can be printed or virtually visualized with the aid to assist the surgeon in preoperative planning and simulation or intraoperative navigation. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the preoperative and intraoperative impact of 3D printed and virtual imaging for robotic NSS. 3D-printed models and virtual reality as new tools for image-guided robot-assisted nephron-sparing surgery: a systematic review of the newest evidences.
