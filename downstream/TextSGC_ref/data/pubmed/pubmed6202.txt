Germline genetic mutations underlie various primary immunodeficiency PID diseases. Patients with rare PID diseases like most non-PID patients and healthy individuals carry on average 20000 rare and common coding variants detected by high-throughput sequencing. It is thus a major challenge to select only a few candidate disease-causing variants for experimental testing. One of the tools commonly used in the pipeline for estimating a potential PID-candidate gene is to test whether the specific gene is included in the list of genes that were already experimentally validated as PID-causing in previous studies. However this approach is limited because it cannot detect the PID-causing mutations in the many PID patients carrying causal mutations of as yet unidentified PID-causing genes. In this study we expanded in silico the list of potential PID-causing candidate genes from 229 to 3110. We first identified the top 1% of human genes predicted by the human genes connectome to be biologically close to the 229 known PID genes. We then further narrowed down the list of genes by retaining only the most biologically relevant genes with functionally enriched gene ontology biological categories similar to those for the known PID genes. We validated this prediction by showing that 17 of the 21 novel PID genes published since the last IUIS classification fall into this group of 3110 genes p\u2009<\u200910-7. The resulting new extended list of 3110 predicted PID genes should be useful for the discovery of novel PID genes in patients.
