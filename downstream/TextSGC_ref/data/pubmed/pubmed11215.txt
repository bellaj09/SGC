Deep learning DL is a powerful technique which has achieved great success in many applications. However its usage in communication systems has not been well explored. This paper investigates algorithms for multi-signals detection and modulation classification which are significant in many communication systems. In this work a DL framework for multi-signals detection and modulation recognition is proposed. Compared to some existing methods the signal modulation format center frequency and start-stop time can be obtained from the proposed scheme. Furthermore two types of networks are built: 1 Single shot multibox detector SSD networks for signal detection and 2 multi-inputs convolutional neural networks CNNs for modulation recognition. Additionally the importance of signal representation to different tasks is investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the DL framework is capable of detecting and recognizing signals. And compared to the traditional methods and other deep network techniques the current built DL framework can achieve better performance.
