"Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treated with exposure with response prevention ERP therapy in which patients are repeatedly exposed to compulsive triggers but prevented from expressing their compulsions. Many compulsions are an attempt to avoid perceived dangers and the intent of ERP is to extinguish compulsions. Patients failing ERP therapy are candidates for deep brain stimulation DBS of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum which facilitates patients response to ERP therapy. An animal model of ERP would be useful for understanding the neural mechanisms of extinction in obsessive-compulsive disorder."
