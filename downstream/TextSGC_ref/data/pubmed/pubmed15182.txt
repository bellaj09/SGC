Posture detection targeted towards providing assessments for the monitoring of health and welfare of pigs has been of great interest to researchers from different disciplines. Existing studies applying machine vision techniques are mostly based on methods using three-dimensional imaging systems or two-dimensional systems with the limitation of monitoring under controlled conditions. Thus the main goal of this study was to determine whether a two-dimensional imaging system along with deep learning approaches could be utilized to detect the standing and lying belly and side postures of pigs under commercial farm conditions. Three deep learning-based detector methods including faster regions with convolutional neural network features Faster R-CNN single shot multibox detector SSD and region-based fully convolutional network R-FCN combined with Inception V2 Residual Network ResNet and Inception ResNet V2 feature extractions of RGB images were proposed. Data from different commercial farms were used for training and validation of the proposed models. The experimental results demonstrated that the R-FCN ResNet101 method was able to detect lying and standing postures with higher average precision AP of 0.93 0.95 and 0.92 for standing lying on side and lying on belly postures respectively and mean average precision mAP of more than 0.93.
