We report a way to make an air-gap-embedded flexible film to reduce the screen-door effect SDE in virtual reality VR displays. Oxygen plasma was treated with a polyethylene terephthalate substrate to produce wavelength-scale micropatterns. These micropatterns induce an effective haze but it is easily destroyed by a very small external scratch. Such a problem could be solved by coating the patterns with polydimethylsiloxane PDMS. The viscosity of PDMS controlled by the ratio of the base and curing agents plays a key role in determining the size of air-gaps at the valleys of micropatterns. As the ratio of base agent increases to 40 the average haze abruptly increased from 0.9% to 88.6% in visible wavelengths while the average total transmittance maintained was between 89.8 and 91.7%. The origin of air-gap-induced haze is confirmed by numerical simulations. The hazy film remarkably reduced the SDE of the VR display from 30.27% to 4.83% for red color from 21.82% to 2.58% for green and from 26.02% to 3.38% for blue as the size of air-gaps increases from 0 to 406  91 nm. No defects were found after 10\u2009000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 3 mm. Air-gap-embedded robust hazy films to reduce the screen-door effect in virtual reality displays.
