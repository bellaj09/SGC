"Whole-cell recordings were used to investigate long-term potentiation of inhibitory synaptic currents IPSCs in neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei DCN in slices. IPSCs were evoked by electrical stimulation of the white matter surrounding the DCN in the presence of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist 67-dinitroquinoxaline-23-dione 20 microM. High-frequency stimulation induced a long-term potentation LTP of the IPSC amplitude without changing its reversal potential rise time and decay-time constant. This LTP did not require the activation of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid-A GABAA receptors but depended on the activation of NMDA receptors. LTP of IPSCs in DCN neurons could also be induced by voltage-depolarizing pulses in postsynaptic neurons and appeared to depend on an increase in intracellular calcium as the LTP was blocked when the cells were loaded with a calcium chelator 12-bis-2-amino-phenoxy-NNN N-tetraacetic acid BAPTA 10 mM. LTP of IPSCs was accompanied by an increase in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs and miniature IPSCs recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin 1 microM but there was no significant change in their amplitude. In addition during the LTP the amplitude of response to exogenously applied GABAA receptor agonist 4567-tetrahydroisoxazolo54-cpyridin-3-ol hydrochloride was increased. Intracellular application of tetanus toxin a powerful blocker of exocytosis in DCN neuron prevented the induction of LTP of IPSCs. Our results suggest that the induction of LTP of IPSCs in the DCN neurons likely involves a postsynaptic locus. Plasticity of inhibitory synaptic transmission in DCN neurons may play a crucial role in cerebellar control of motor coordination and learning."
