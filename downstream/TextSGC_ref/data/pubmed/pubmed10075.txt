Recognizing human physical activities using wireless sensor networks has attracted significant research interest due to its broad range of applications such as healthcare rehabilitation athletics and senior monitoring. There are critical challenges inherent in designing a sensor-based activity recognition system operating in and around a lossy medium such as the human body to gain a trade-off among power consumption cost computational complexity and accuracy. We introduce an innovative wireless system based on magnetic induction for human activity recognition to tackle these challenges and constraints. The magnetic induction system is integrated with machine learning techniques to detect a wide range of human motions. This approach is successfully evaluated using synthesized datasets laboratory measurements and deep recurrent neural networks.
