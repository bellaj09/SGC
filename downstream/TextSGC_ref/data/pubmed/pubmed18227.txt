Power transmission line icing PTLI problems which cause tremendous damage to the power grids has drawn much attention. Existing three-dimensional measurement methods based on binocular stereo vision was recently introduced to measure the ice thickness in PTLI but failed to meet requirements of practical applications due to inefficient keypoint matching in the complex PTLI scene. In this paper a new keypoint matching method is proposed based on the local multi-layer convolutional neural network CNN features termed Local Convolutional Features LCFs. LCFs are deployed to extract more discriminative features than the conventional CNNs. Particularly in LCFs a multi-layer features fusion scheme is exploited to boost the matching performance. Together with a location constraint method the correspondence of neighboring keypoints is further refined. Our approach achieves 1.5% 5.3% 13.1% 27.3% improvement in the average matching precision compared with SIFT SURF ORB and MatchNet on the public Middlebury dataset and the measurement accuracy of ice thickness can reach 90.9% compared with manual measurement on the collected PTLI dataset.
