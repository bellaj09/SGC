Epilepsy is a neurological disorder of the brain which involves recurrent seizures. An encephalogram EEG is a gold standard method in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However the standard EEG recording system is too obstructive to be used in daily life. Behind-the-ear EEG is an alternative approach to record EEG conveniently. Previous researchers applied machine learning to automatically detect seizures with EEG but the epileptic EEG waveform contains subtle changes that are difficult to be identified. Furthermore the extremely small proportion of ictal events in the long-term monitoring may cause the imbalance problem and consequently poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. In this study we present an automatic seizure detection algorithm with a generative adversarial network GAN trained by unsupervised learning and evaluated it with behind-the-ear EEG. Unsupervised automatic seizure detection for focal-onset seizures recorded with behind-the-ear EEG using an anomaly-detecting generative adversarial network.
