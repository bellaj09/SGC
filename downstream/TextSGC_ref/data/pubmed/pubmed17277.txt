"Individuals with neurodegenerative disease NDD commonly have elevated cognitive-motor interference change in either cognitive or motor performance or both when tasks are performed simultaneously compared to healthy controls. Given that cognitive-motor interference is related to reduced community ambulation and elevated fall risk it is a target of rehabilitation interventions. Areas covered: This review details the collective findings of previous dual task interventions in individuals with NDD. A total of 21 investigations focusing on 4 different neurodegenerative diseases and one NDD precursor Parkinsons disease multiple sclerosis Alzheimers disease AD dementia other than AD and mild cognitive impairment consisting of 721 participants were reviewed. Expert commentary: Preliminary evidence from interventions targeting cognitive-motor interference both directly and indirectly show promising results for improving CMI in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. Methodological limitations common to pilot investigations preclude firm conclusions. Well-designed randomized control trials targeting cognitive motor interference are warranted."
