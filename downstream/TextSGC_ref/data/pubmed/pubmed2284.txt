"To survive in an ever-changing environment the brain must seamlessly integrate a rich stream of incoming information into coherent internal representations that can then be used to efficiently plan for action. The brain must however balance its ability to integrate information from various sources with a complementary capacity to segregate information into modules which perform specialized computations in local circuits. Importantly evidence suggests that imbalances in the brains ability to bind together and/or segregate information over both space and time is a common feature of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Most studies have however until recently strictly attempted to characterize the principles of integration and segregation in static i.e. time-invariant representations of human brain networks hence disregarding the complex spatio-temporal nature of these processes. In the present Review we describe how the emerging discipline of whole-brain computational connectomics may be used to study the causal mechanisms of the integration and segregation of information on behaviourally relevant timescales. We emphasize how novel methods from network science and whole-brain computational modelling can expand beyond traditional neuroimaging paradigms and help to uncover the neurobiological determinants of the abnormal integration and segregation of information in neuropsychiatric disorders.This article is part of the themed issue Mathematical methods in medicine: neuroscience cardiology and pathology." Understanding principles of integration and segregation using whole-brain computational connectomics: implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.
