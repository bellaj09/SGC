PET images often suffer poor signal-to-noise ratio SNR. Our objective is to improve the SNR of PET images using a deep neural network DNN model and MRI images without requiring any higher SNR PET images in training. Our proposed DNN model consists of three modified U-Nets 3U-net. The PET training input data and targets were reconstructed using filtered-backprojection FBP and maximum likelihood expectation maximization MLEM respectively. FBP reconstruction was used because of its computational efficiency so that the trained network not only removes noise but also accelerates image reconstruction. Digital brain phantoms downloaded from BrainWeb were used to evaluate the proposed method. Poisson noise was added into sinogram data to simulate a 6\u2009min brain PET scan. Attenuation effect was included and corrected before the image reconstruction. Extra Poisson noise was introduced to the training inputs to improve the network denoising capability. Three independent experiments were conducted to examine the reproducibility. A lesion was inserted into testing data to evaluate the impact of mismatched MRI information using the contrast-to-noise ratio CNR. The negative impact on noise reduction was also studied when miscoregistration between PET and MRI images occurs. Compared with 1U-net trained with only PET images training with PET/MRI decreased the mean squared error MSE by 31.3% and 34.0% for 1U-net and 3U-net respectively. The MSE reduction is equivalent to an increase in the count level by 2.5 folds and 2.9 folds for 1U-net and 3U-net respectively. Compared with the MLEM images the lesion CNR was improved 2.7 folds and 1.4 folds for 1U-net and 3U-net respectively. The results show that the proposed method could improve the PET SNR without having higher SNR PET images. Higher SNR PET image prediction using a deep learning model and MRI image.
