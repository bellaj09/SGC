"Emotion is a ubiquitous aspect of humanity that governs behavior in a number of ways and is linked inextricably with health. Pausing to evaluate ones emotional state in the face of decisions and reflecting on past patterns of emotion have been shown to improve behaviors. Further social expression of emotion has been shown to directly improve health outcomes. While the virtual reality research community does not ignore emotion on the whole there does exist a need to explore what roles emotional awareness and emotion sharing can play in this domain."
