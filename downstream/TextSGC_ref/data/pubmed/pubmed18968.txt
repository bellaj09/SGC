Virtual reality is consistently reported as effective in reducing pain and anxiety in children during burns dressing changes in recent Western studies. Pain scales are a commonly reported outcome measure. Virtual reality is persuasive for all children in distress during medical procedures because it is a nonaddictive novel and inexpensive form of distraction which can be applied repeatedly with good effect. We intend to use virtual reality in South Africa for the many children hospitalized with severe burns from mechanisms rarely seen in the Western world paraffin/kerosene stoves exploding electrical fires shack/township fires boiling liquid spills. Many severely burnt children are indigenous South Africans who did not speak English and whose illiteracy levels cultures family dynamics and experiences of pain potentially invalidate the use of conventional pain scales as outcome measures. The purpose of this study was to identify objective measures with sound psychometric properties and strong clinical utility to assess distress during burns dressing changes in hospitalized indigenous South African children. Choice of measures was constrained by the burns dressing change environment the ethics of doing no harm whilst measuring distress in vulnerable children and of capturing valid measures of distress over the entire burns dressing change procedure.
