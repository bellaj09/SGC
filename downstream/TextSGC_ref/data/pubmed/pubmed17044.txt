Deep brain stimulation DBS is an established therapeutic modality for the treatment of movement disorders and an emerging therapeutic approach for the treatment of disorders of mood and thought. For example recently we have shown that DBS of the fornix may ameliorate cognitive decline associated with dementia. However like other applications of DBS the mechanisms mediating these clinical effects are unknown. As DBS modulates neurophysiological activity in targeted brain regions DBS might influence cognitive function via activity-dependent regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Using stimulation parameters analogous to clinical high-frequency DBS here we addressed this question in mice. We found that acute stimulation of the entorhinal cortex EC transiently promoted proliferation in the dentate gyrus DG. Cells generated as a consequence of stimulation differentiated into neurons survived for at least several weeks and acquired normal dentate granule cell DGC morphology. Importantly stimulation-induced promotion of neurogenesis was limited to the DG and not associated with changes in apoptotic cell death. Using immunohistochemical approaches we found that once sufficiently mature these stimulation-induced neurons integrated into hippocampal circuits supporting water-maze memory. Finally formation of water-maze memory was facilitated 6 weeks but not 1 week after bilateral stimulation of the EC. The delay-dependent nature of these effects matches the maturation-dependent integration of adult-generated DGCs into dentate circuits supporting water-maze memory. Furthermore because the beneficial effects of EC stimulation were prevented by blocking neurogenesis this suggests a causal relationship between stimulation-induced promotion of adult neurogenesis and enhanced spatial memory. Stimulation of entorhinal cortex promotes adult neurogenesis and facilitates spatial memory.
