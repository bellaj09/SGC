A series of experiments examined the role of the motor system in imagined movement finding a strong relationship between imagined walking performance and the biomechanical information available during actual walking. Experiments 1 through 4 established the finding that real and imagined locomotion differ in absolute walking time. We then tested whether executed actions could provide a basis for imagined walking rate using 2 approaches. Experiments 5 and 6 used a perceptual-motor recalibration paradigm finding that after physically walking in a treadmill virtual reality environment actors recalibrated the time to imagine walking to a previously viewed target. This finding mirrors previous perceptual-motor recalibration work measuring actual walking to previously viewed targets. Experiments 7 and 8 used a dual-task paradigm in which actions performed concurrently with imagined walking increased the similarity between real and imagined walking time but only when they were biomechanically consistent with the act of walking. The striking influence of biomechanical information on imagined locomotion provides evidence for shared motor systems in imagined and executed movements and is also directly relevant to the mechanisms involved in egocentric spatial updating of environmental layout.
