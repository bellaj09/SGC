This study aimed at elucidating the relationship between the number of computed tomography CT images including data concerning the accuracy of models and contrast enhancement for classifying the images. We enrolled 1539 patients who underwent contrast or noncontrast CT imaging followed by dividing the CT imaging dataset for creating classification models into 10 classes for brain neck chest abdomen and pelvis with contrast-enhanced and plain imaging. The number of images prepared in each class were 100 500 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 and 10000. Accordingly the names of datasets were defined as 0.1K 0.5K 1K 2K 3K 4K 5K 6K 7K 8K 9K and 10K respectively. We subsequently created and evaluated the models and compared the convolutional neural network CNN architecture between AlexNet and GoogLeNet. The time required for training models of AlexNet was lesser than that for GoogLeNet. The best overall accuracy for the classification of 10 classes was 0.721 with the 10K dataset of GoogLeNet. Furthermore the best overall accuracy for the classification of the slice position without contrast media was 0.862 with the 2K dataset of AlexNet.
