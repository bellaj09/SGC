Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are often based on the control of sensorimotor processes yet sensorimotor processes are impaired in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS. We devised a new paradigm that targets higher-level cognitive processes to transmit information from the user to the BCI. We instructed five ALS patients and twelve healthy subjects to either activate self-referential memories or to focus on a process without mnemonic content while recording a high-density electroencephalogram EEG. Both tasks are designed to modulate activity in the default mode network DMN without involving sensorimotor pathways. We find that the two tasks can be distinguished after only one experimental session from the average of the combined bandpower modulations in the theta- 4-7Hz and alpha-range 8-13Hz with an average accuracy of 62.5% and 60.8% for healthy subjects and ALS patients respectively. The spatial weights of the decoding algorithm show a preference for the parietal area consistent with modulation of neural activity in primary nodes of the DMN.
