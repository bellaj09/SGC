Common spatial pattern CSP is most widely used in motor imagery based brain-computer interface BCI systems. In conventional CSP algorithm pairs of the eigenvectors corresponding to both extreme eigenvalues are selected to construct the optimal spatial filter. In addition an appropriate selection of subject-specific time segments and frequency bands plays an important role in its successful application.
