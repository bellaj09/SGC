Classical eyeblink conditioning is a representative associative motor learning that requires both the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nucleus DCN. Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 mGluR1 is richly expressed in Purkinje cells PCs of the cerebellar cortex. Global mGluR1 knock-out KO mice show a significantly lower percentage of conditioned response CR% than wild-type mice in eyeblink conditioning and the impaired CR% is restored by the introduction of mGluR1 in PCs. However the specific roles of mGluR1 in major memory processes including formation storage and expression have not yet been defined. We thus examined the role of mGluR1 in these processes of eyeblink conditioning using mGluR1 conditional KO cKO mice harboring a selective and reversible expression of mGluR1 in PCs. We have\xa0found that eyeblink memory is not latently formed in the absence of mGluR1 in adult mouse PCs. However once acquired eyeblink memory is expressed even after the depletion of mGluR1 in PCs. We thus conclude that mGluR1 in PCs\xa0is indispensable for the formation of eyeblink memory while it is not required for the expression of CR. mGluR1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells is essential for the formation but not expression of associative eyeblink memory.
