Caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Lyme disease LD is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in North America and Europe. Though timely diagnosis and treatment are effective in preventing disease progression current tests are insensitive in early stage LD with a sensitivity of <50%. Additionally the serological testing currently recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control has high costs >$400/test and extended sample-to-answer timelines >24 h. To address these challenges we created a cost-effective and rapid point-of-care POC test for early-stage LD that assays for antibodies specific to seven Borrelia antigens and a synthetic peptide in a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay xVFA. We trained a deep-learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets and then blindly tested our xVFA using human samples N+ = 42 N- = 54 achieving an area-under-the-curve AUC sensitivity and specificity of 0.950 90.5% and 87.0% respectively outperforming previous LD POC tests. With batch-specific standardization and threshold tuning the specificity of our blind-testing performance improved to 96.3% with an AUC and sensitivity of 0.963 and 85.7% respectively.
