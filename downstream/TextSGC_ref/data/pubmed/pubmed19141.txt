"Advances in sports sciences and neurosciences offer new opportunities to design efficient and motivating sport training tools. For instance using NeuroFeedback NF athletes can learn to self-regulate specific brain rhythms and consequently improve their performances. Here we focused on soccer goalkeepers Covert Visual Spatial Attention CVSA abilities which are essential for these athletes to reach high performances. We looked for Electroencephalography EEG markers of CVSA usable for virtual reality-based NF training procedures i.e. markers that comply with the following criteria: 1 specific to CVSA 2 detectable in real-time and 3 related to goalkeepers performance/expertise. Our results revealed that the best-known EEG marker of CVSA-increased -power ipsilateral to the attended hemi-field- was not usable since it did not comply with criteria 2 and 3. Nonetheless we highlighted a significant positive correlation between athletes improvement in CVSA abilities and the increase of their -power at rest. While the specificity of this marker remains to be demonstrated it complied with both criteria 2 and 3. This result suggests that it may be possible to design innovative ecological training procedures for goalkeepers for instance using a combination of NF and cognitive tasks performed in virtual reality."
