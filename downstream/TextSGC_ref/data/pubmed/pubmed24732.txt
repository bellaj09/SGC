An EEG classifier is proposed for application in the analysis of motor imagery MI EEG data from a brain-computer interface BCI competition in this study. Applying subject-action-related brainwave data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices the system primarily consists of artifact and background removal feature extraction feature selection and classification. In addition to background noise the electrooculographic EOG artifacts are also automatically removed to further improve the analysis of EEG signals. Several potential features including amplitude modulation spectral power and asymmetry ratio adaptive autoregressive model and wavelet fuzzy approximate entropy wfApEn that can measure and quantify the complexity or irregularity of EEG signals are then extracted for subsequent classification. Finally the significant sub-features are selected from feature combination by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization and then classified by support vector machine SVM. Compared with feature extraction without wfApEn on MI data from two data sets for nine subjects the results indicate that the proposed system including wfApEn obtains better performance in average classification accuracy of 88.2% and average number of commands per minute of 12.1 which is promising in the BCI work applications.
