Under the six-year pharmaceutical education system that was initiated in April 2006 students who had completed the course in March 2012 became the first graduates. The six-year system encourages students to develop a well-rounded personality a deep sense of ethics knowledge required for health care professionals abilities to identify and solve problems and practical skills required in clinical settings as well as basic knowledge and skills. Under the new education system based on the "pharmaceutical education model core curriculums" and "practical training model core curriculums" general pharmaceutical education is implemented in each college and five-month practical training is conducted in clinical settings. Clinical tasks experienced by students for the first time are expected to significantly influence their motivation to learn and future prospects. In the present survey research students who had completed practical training evaluated the training program and correspondence and logistic regression analyses of the results were conducted to examine the future effects and influences of the training on the students. The results suggest that the students viewed the practical training program positively. In addition clinical experience during the training sessions not only influenced their decisions on future careers but also significantly increased their motivation to learn. Furthermore their motivation for learning was increased most by the enthusiasm of pharmacists who advised them in clinical settings rather than the training program itself. To improve pharmaceutical clinical learning it is important to develop teaching and working environments for pharmacists in charge of advising students in clinical training.
