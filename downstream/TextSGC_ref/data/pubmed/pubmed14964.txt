"fMRI data decomposition techniques have advanced significantly from shallow models such as Independent Component Analysis ICA and Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning SCDL to deep learning models such Deep Belief Networks DBN and Convolutional Autoencoder DCAE. However interpretations of those decomposed networks are still open questions due to the lack of functional brain atlases no correspondence across decomposed or reconstructed networks across different subjects and significant individual variabilities. Recent studies showed that deep learning especially deep convolutional neural networks CNN has extraordinary ability of accommodating spatial object patterns e.g. our recent works using 3D CNN for fMRI-derived network classifications achieved high accuracy with a remarkable tolerance for mistakenly labelled training brain networks. However the training data preparation is one of the biggest obstacles in these supervised deep learning models for functional brain network map recognitions since manual labelling requires tedious and time-consuming labours which will sometimes even introduce label mistakes. Especially for mapping functional networks in large scale datasets such as hundreds of thousands of brain networks used in this paper the manual labelling method will become almost infeasible. In response in this work we tackled both the network recognition and training data labelling tasks by proposing a new iteratively optimized deep learning CNN IO-CNN framework with an automatic weak label initialization which enables the functional brain networks recognition task to a fully automatic large-scale classification procedure. Our extensive experiments based on ABIDE-II 1099 brains fMRI data showed the great promise of our IO-CNN framework."
