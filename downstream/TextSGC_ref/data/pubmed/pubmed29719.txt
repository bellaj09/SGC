"An emerging challenge for emotion classification using electroencephalography EEG is how to effectively alleviate day-to-day variability in raw data. This study employed the robust principal component analysis RPCA to address the problem with a posed hypothesis that background or emotion-irrelevant EEG perturbations lead to certain variability across days and somehow submerge emotion-related EEG dynamics. The empirical results of this study evidently validated our hypothesis and demonstrated the RPCAs feasibility through the analysis of a five-day dataset of 12 subjects. The RPCA allowed tackling the sparse emotion-relevant EEG dynamics from the accompanied background perturbations across days. Sequentially leveraging the RPCA-purified EEG trials from more days appeared to improve the emotion-classification performance steadily which was not found in the case using the raw EEG features. Therefore incorporating the RPCA with existing emotion-aware machine-learning frameworks on a longitudinal dataset of each individual may shed light on the development of a robust affective brain-computer interface ABCI that can alleviate ecological inter-day variability."
