"As observers we excel in decoding the emotional signals telling us that a social interaction is turning violent. The neural substrate and its modulation by personality traits remain ill understood. We performed an fMRI experiment in which participants watched videos displaying a violent conflict between two people. Observers attention was directed to either the aggressor or the victim. Focusing on the aggressor vs. focusing on the victim activated the superior temporal sulcus STS extra-striate body area EBA occipital poles and centro-medial amygdala CMA. Stronger instantaneous connectivity occurred between these and the EBA insula and the red nucleus. When focusing on the victim basolateral amygdala BLA activation was related to trait empathy and showed increased connectivity with the insula and red nucleus. STS activation was associated with trait aggression and increased connectivity with the hypothalamus. The findings reveal that focusing on the aggressor of a violent conflict triggers more activation in categorical EBA and emotion CMA STS areas. This is associated with increased instantaneous connectivity among emotion areas CMA-insula and between categorical and emotion EBA-STS areas. When the focus is on the victim personality traits aggression/empathy modulate activity in emotion areas respectively STS and postcentral gyrus/ BLA along with connectivity in the emotional diencephalon hypothalamus and early visual areas occipital pole." Personality traits predict brain activation and connectivity when witnessing a violent conflict.
