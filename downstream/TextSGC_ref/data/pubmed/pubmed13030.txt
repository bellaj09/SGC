"Mild cognitive impairment MCI represents the intermediate stage between normal cerebral aging and dementia associated with Alzheimers disease AD. Early diagnosis of MCI and AD through artificial intelligence has captured considerable scholarly interest; researchers hope to develop therapies capable of slowing or halting these processes. We developed a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm based on an optimized convolutional neural network CNN topology called MCADNNet that simultaneously recognizes MCI AD and normally aging brains in adults over the age of 75 years using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data. Following highly detailed preprocessing four-dimensional 4D fMRI and 3D MRI were decomposed to create 2D images using a lossless transformation which enables maximum preservation of data details. The samples were shuffled and subject-level training and testing datasets were completely independent. The optimized MCADNNet was trained and extracted invariant and hierarchical features through convolutional layers followed by multi-classification in the last layer using a softmax layer. A decision-making algorithm was also designed to stabilize the outcome of the trained models. To measure the performance of classification the accuracy rates for various pipelines were calculated before and after applying the decision-making algorithm. Accuracy rates of 99.77% 0.36% and 97.5% 1.16% were achieved for MRI and fMRI pipelines respectively after applying the decision-making algorithm. In conclusion a cutting-edge and optimized topology called MCADNNet was designed and preceded a preprocessing pipeline; this was followed by a decision-making step that yielded the highest performance achieved for simultaneous classification of the three cohorts examined."
