This paper proposes a novel multi-sensor-based indoor global localization system integrating visual localization aided by CNN-based image retrieval with a probabilistic localization approach. The global localization system consists of three parts: coarse place recognition fine localization and re-localization from kidnapping. Coarse place recognition exploits a monocular camera to realize the initial localization based on image retrieval in which off-the-shelf features extracted from a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network CNN are adopted to determine the candidate locations of the robot. In the fine localization a laser range finder is equipped to estimate the accurate pose of a mobile robot by means of an adaptive Monte Carlo localization in which the candidate locations obtained by image retrieval are considered as seeds for initial random sampling. Additionally to address the problem of robot kidnapping we present a closed-loop localization mechanism to monitor the state of the robot in real time and make adaptive adjustments when the robot is kidnapped. The closed-loop mechanism effectively exploits the correlation of image sequences to realize the re-localization based on Long-Short Term Memory LSTM network. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results indicate that the proposed method not only exhibits great improvement on accuracy and speed but also can recover from localization failures compared to two conventional localization methods.
