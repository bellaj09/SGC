Computer-generated graphics CGs are images generated by computer software. The rapid development of computer graphics technologies has made it easier to generate photorealistic computer graphics and these graphics are quite difficult to distinguish from natural images NIs with the naked eye. In this paper we propose a method based on sensor pattern noise SPN and deep learning to distinguish CGs from NIs. Before being fed into our convolutional neural network CNN-based model these images&mdash;CGs and NIs&mdash;are clipped into image patches. Furthermore three high-pass filters HPFs are used to remove low-frequency signals which represent the image content. These filters are also used to reveal the residual signal as well as SPN introduced by the digital camera device. Different from the traditional methods of distinguishing CGs from NIs the proposed method utilizes a five-layer CNN to classify the input image patches. Based on the classification results of the image patches we deploy a majority vote scheme to obtain the classification results for the full-size images. The experiments have demonstrated that 1 the proposed method with three HPFs can achieve better results than that with only one HPF or no HPF and that 2 the proposed method with three HPFs achieves 100% accuracy although the NIs undergo a JPEG compression with a quality factor of 75.
