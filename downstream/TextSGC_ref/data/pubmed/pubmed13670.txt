An improved fast region-based convolutional neural network RCNN algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of recognizing broilers in a stunned state. The algorithm recognizes 3 stunned state conditions: insufficiently stunned moderately stunned and excessively stunned. Image samples of stunned broilers were collected from a slaughter line using an image acquisition platform. According to the format of PASCAL VOC pattern analysis statistical modeling and computational learning visual object classes dataset a dataset for each broiler stunned state condition was obtained using an annotation tool to mark the chicken head and wing area in the original image. A rotation and flip data augmentation method was used to enhance the effectiveness of the datasets. Based on the principle of a residual network a multi-layer residual module MRM was constructed to facilitate more detailed feature extraction. A model was then developed entitled here Faster-RCNN+MRMnet and used to detect broiler stunned state conditions. When applied to a reinforcing dataset containing 27828 images of chickens in a stunned state the identification accuracy of the model was 98.06%. This was significantly higher than both the established back propagation neural network model 90.11% and another Faster-RCNN model 96.86%. The proposed algorithm can complete the inspection of the stunned state of more than 40000 broilers per hour. The approach can be used for online inspection applications to increase efficiency reduce labor and cost and yield significant benefits for poultry processing plants.
