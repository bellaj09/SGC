"Little is known about how therapists promote learning of functional motor skills for children with acquired brain injuries. This study explores physiotherapists description of these interventions in comparison to virtual reality VR video game-based therapy. Six physiotherapists employed at a childrens rehabilitation center participated in semi-structured interviews which were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Physiotherapists describe using interventions that motivate children to challenge performance quality and optimize real-life functioning. Intervention strategies are influenced by characteristics of the child parent availability to practice skills outside therapy and therapist experience. VR use motivates children to participate but can influence therapist use of verbal strategies and complicate interventions. Physiotherapists consider unique characteristics of this population when providing interventions that promote learning of motor skills. The VR technology has advantageous features but its use with this population can be challenging; further research is recommended."
