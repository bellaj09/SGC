In the case of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC samples classification of differentiation is crucial for determining prognosis and treatment strategy decisions. However a label-free and automated classification system for HCC grading has not been yet developed. Hence in this study we demonstrate the fusion of multiphoton microscopy and a deep-learning algorithm for classifying HCC differentiation to produce an innovative computer-aided diagnostic method. Convolutional neural networks based on the VGG-16 framework were trained using 217 combined two-photon excitation fluorescence and second-harmonic generation images; the resulting classification accuracy of the HCC differentiation grade was over 90%. Our results suggest that a combination of multiphoton microscopy and deep learning can realize label-free automated methods for various tissues diseases and other related classification problems.
