The morphometric analysis of myelinated nerve fibers of peripheral nerves in cross-sectional optical microscopic images is valuable. Several automated methods for nerve fiber identification and segmentation have been reported. This paper presents a new method that uses a deep learning model of a convolutional neural network CNN. We tested it for human sural nerve biopsy images. Identification and segmentation of myelinated nerve fibers in a cross-sectional optical microscopic image using a deep learning model.
