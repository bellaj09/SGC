To inform surgeons about the practical issues to be considered for successful integration of virtual reality simulation into a surgical training program. The learning and practice of minimally invasive surgery MIS makes unique demands on surgical training programs. A decade ago Satava proposed virtual reality VR surgical simulation as a solution for this problem. Only recently have robust scientific studies supported that vision Virtual reality simulation for the operating room: proficiency-based training as a paradigm shift in surgical skills training.
