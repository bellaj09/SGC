Nurses must be prepared to care for patients following a disaster including patients exposed to hazardous contaminants. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of virtual reality simulation VRS to teach the disaster-specific skill of decontamination. A quasi-experimental design was used to assign nursing students from 2 baccalaureate nursing programs to 1 of 2 groups to learn the disaster skill of decontamination-printed written directions or VRS. Performance knowledge and self-efficacy were outcome measures. Although students in the treatment group had significantly lower performance scores than the control group p = 0.004 students taking part in VRS completed the skill in a significantly shorter amount of time p = 0.008. No significant group differences were found for self-efficacy p = 0.172 or knowledge p = 0.631. However students in the VRS treatment group reported high levels of satisfaction with VRS as a training method. The disaster-specific skill of decontamination is a low-volume high-risk skill that must be performed with accuracy to protect both exposed patients and providers performing decontamination. As frontline providers for casualties following a disaster event emergency nurses must be prepared to perform this skill when needed. Preparation requires cost-effective timely and evidence-based educational opportunities that promote positive outcomes. Further investigation is needed to determine the benefits and long-term effects of VRS for disaster education. Decontamination training: with and without virtual reality simulation.
