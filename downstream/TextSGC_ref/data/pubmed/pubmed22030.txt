Adaptive flexibility is of significance for the smooth and efficient movements in goal attainment. However the underlying work mechanism of the cerebral cortex in adaptive motor control still remains unclear. How does the cerebral cortex organize and coordinate the activity of a large population of cells in the implementation of various motor strategies? To explore this issue single-unit activities from the M1 region and kinematic data were recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing 3D reach-to-grasp tasks with different perturbations. Varying motor control strategies were employed and achieved in different perturbed tasks via the dynamic allocation of cells to modulate specific movement parameters. An economic principle was proposed for the first time to describe a basic rule for cell allocation in the primary motor cortex. This principle defined as the Dynamic Economic Cell Allocation Mechanism DECAM guarantees benefit maximization in cell allocation under limited neuronal resources and avoids committing resources to uneconomic investments for unreliable factors with no or little revenue. That is to say the cells recruited are always preferentially allocated to those factors with reliable return; otherwise the cells are dispatched to respond to other factors about task. The findings of this study might partially reveal the working mechanisms underlying the role of the cerebral cortex in adaptive motor control wherein is also of significance for the design of future intelligent brain-machine interfaces and rehabilitation device.
