Desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythms SMR is a distinctive feature that provides a discriminative pattern for BCI operation. However individuals such as BCI illiterates can not produce these discriminable patterns with sufficient reliability. Additionally SMR desynchronization can become deteriorated or extinct in patients with spinal cord injury or a cerebrovascular accident. In all these situations BCI usage is compromised. This paper proposes an intervention based on neurofeedback training of the upper alpha band to improve SMR desynchronization. The feasibility of this intervention is demonstrated in a preliminary study in which five healthy subjects were trained to increase their upper alpha band power. Such increases produced higher SMR desynchronization and better discrimination between rest and execution states of a motor task. Upper alpha neurofeedback training over the motor cortex increases SMR desynchronization in motor tasks.
