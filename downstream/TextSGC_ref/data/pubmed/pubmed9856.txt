Recent advances in saliency detection have utilized deep learning to obtain high-level features to detect salient regions in scenes. These advances have yielded results superior to those reported in past work which involved the use of hand-crafted low-level features for saliency detection. In this paper we propose ELD-Net a unified deep learning framework for accurate and efficient saliency detection. We show that hand-crafted features can provide complementary information to enhance saliency detection that uses only high-level features. Our method uses both low-level and high-level features for saliency detection. High-level features are extracted using GoogLeNet and low-level features evaluate the relative importance of a local region using its differences from other regions in an image. The two feature maps are independently encoded by the convolutional and the ReLU layers. The encoded low-level and high-level features are then combined by concatenation and convolution. Finally a linear fully connected layer is used to evaluate the saliency of a queried region. A full resolution saliency map is obtained by querying the saliency of each local region of an image. Since the high-level features are encoded at low resolution and the encoded high-level features can be reused for every query region our ELD-Net is very fast. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based saliency detection methods. ELD-Net: An Efficient Deep Learning Architecture for Accurate Saliency Detection.
