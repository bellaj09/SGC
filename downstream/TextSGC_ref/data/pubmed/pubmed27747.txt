Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is a disorder associated primarily with the degeneration of the motor system. More recently functional connectivity studies have demonstrated potentially adaptive changes in ALS brain organization but disease-related changes in cortical communication remain unknown. We recruited individuals with ALS and age-matched controls to operate a brain-computer interface while electroencephalography was recorded over three sessions. Using normalized symbolic transfer entropy we measured directed functional connectivity from frontal to parietal feedback connectivity and parietal to frontal feedforward connectivity regions. Feedback connectivity was not significantly different between groups but feedforward connectivity was significantly higher in individuals with ALS. This result was consistent across a broad electroencephalographic spectrum 4-35 Hz and in theta alpha and beta frequency bands. Feedback connectivity has been associated with conscious state and was found to be independent of ALS symptom severity in this study which may have significant implications for the detection of consciousness in individuals with advanced ALS. We suggest that increases in feedforward connectivity represent a compensatory response to the ALS-related loss of input such that sensory stimuli have sufficient strength to cross the threshold necessary for conscious processing in the global neuronal workspace.
