Enhancer-promoter interactions EPIs are crucial for transcriptional regulation. Mapping such interactions proves useful for understanding disease regulations and discovering risk genes in genome-wide association studies. Some previous studies showed that machine learning methods as computational alternatives to costly experimental approaches performed well in predicting EPIs from local sequence and/or local epigenomic data. In particular deep learning methods were demonstrated to outperform traditional machine learning methods and using DNA sequence data alone could perform either better than or almost as well as only utilizing epigenomic data. However most if not all of these previous studies were based on randomly splitting enhancer-promoter pairs as training tuning and test data which has recently been pointed out to be problematic; due to multiple and duplicating/overlapping enhancers and promoters in enhancer-promoter pairs in EPI data such random splitting does not lead to independent training tuning and test data thus resulting in model over-fitting and over-estimating predictive performance. Here after correcting this design issue we extensively studied the performance of various deep learning models with local sequence and epigenomic data around enhancer-promoter pairs. Our results confirmed much lower performance using either sequence or epigenomic data alone or both than reported previously. We also demonstrated that local epigenomic features were more informative than local sequence data. Our results were based on an extensive exploration of many convolutional neural network CNN and feed-forward neural network FNN structures and of gradient boosting as a representative of traditional machine learning. Local Epigenomic Data are more Informative than Local Genome Sequence Data in Predicting Enhancer-Promoter Interactions Using Neural Networks.
