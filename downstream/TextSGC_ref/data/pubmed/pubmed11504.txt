Biomarker computation using deep-learning often relies on a two-step process where the deep learning algorithm segments the region of interest and then the biomarker is measured. We propose an alternative paradigm where the biomarker is estimated directly using a regression network. We showcase this image-to-biomarker paradigm using two biomarkers: the estimation of bone mineral density BMD and the estimation of lung percentage of emphysema from CT scans. Deep learning for biomarker regression: application to osteoporosis and emphysema on chest CT scans.
