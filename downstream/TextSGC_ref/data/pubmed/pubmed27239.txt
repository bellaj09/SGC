Electroencephalogram EEG classification for brain-computer interface BCI is a new way of realizing human-computer interreaction. In this paper the application of semi-supervised sparse representation classifier algorithms based on help training to EEG classification for BCI is reported. Firstly the correlation information of the unlabeled data is obtained by sparse representation classifier and some data with high correlation selected. Secondly the boundary information of the selected data is produced by discriminative classifier which is the Fisher linear classifier. The final unlabeled data with high confidence are selected by a criterion containing the information of distance and direction. We applied this novel method to the three benchmark datasets which were BCI I BCI II_IV and USPS. The classification rate were 97% 82% and 84.7% respectively. Moreover the fastest arithmetic rate was just about 0. 2 s. The classification rate and efficiency results of the novel method are both better than those of S3VM and SVM proving that the proposed method is effective.
