"It has been demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the retina can produce visual percepts in blind patients suffering from macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. However current retinal implants provide very low resolution just a few electrodes whereas at least several thousand pixels would be required for functional restoration of sight. This paper presents the design of an optoelectronic retinal prosthetic system with a stimulating pixel density of up to 2500 pix mm-2 corresponding geometrically to a maximum visual acuity of 20/80. Requirements on proximity of neural cells to the stimulation electrodes are described as a function of the desired resolution. Two basic geometries of sub-retinal implants providing required proximity are presented: perforated membranes and protruding electrode arrays. To provide for natural eye scanning of the scene rather than scanning with a head-mounted camera the system operates similar to virtual reality devices. An image from a video camera is projected by a goggle-mounted collimated infrared LED-LCD display onto the retina activating an array of powered photodiodes in the retinal implant. The goggles are transparent to visible light thus allowing for the simultaneous use of remaining natural vision along with prosthetic stimulation. Optical delivery of visual information to the implant allows for real-time image processing adjustable to retinal architecture as well as flexible control of image processing algorithms and stimulation parameters."
