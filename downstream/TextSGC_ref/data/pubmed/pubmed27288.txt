"For intracortical brain-machine interfaces BMIs action potential voltage waveforms are often sorted to separate out individual neurons. If these neurons contain independent tuning information this process could increase BMI performance. However the sorting of action potentials spikes requires high sampling rates and is computationally expensive. To explicitly define the difference between spike sorting and alternative methods we quantified BMI decoder performance when using threshold-crossing events versus sorted action potentials." Comparison of spike sorting and thresholding of voltage waveforms for intracortical brain-machine interface performance.
