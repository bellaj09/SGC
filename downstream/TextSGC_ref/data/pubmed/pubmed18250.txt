Stroke is the main cause of disability in adulthood. Recent advances in virtual reality VR technologies have led to its increased use in the rehabilitation of stroke patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials RCTs was conducted to determine the effectiveness of game-based reality on upper limb UL motor function and quality of life after stroke. In March 2018 a search of the following databases was performed: PubMed PEDro Web of Science Scopus The Cochrane Library and Medline at EBSCO. The selection criteria were all RCTs published in English or Spanish during the past 10 years. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. A total of 20 clinical trials were included in the systemic review of which 15 contributed information to the meta-analysis. Favorable results were found for VR interventions on UL motor function Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity standardized mean difference SMD\u2009=\u20091.53 95% CI 0.51-2.54 and quality of life functional independence measure SMD\u2009=\u20090.77 95% CI 0.05-1.49. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of VR interventions on the recovery of UL motor function and on quality of life after stroke.
