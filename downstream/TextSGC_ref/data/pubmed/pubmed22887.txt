A key problem in systems neuroscience is to characterize how populations of neurons encode information in their patterns of activity. An understanding of the encoding process is essential both for gaining insight into the origins of perception and for the development of brain-computer interfaces. However this characterization is complicated by the highly variable nature of neural responses and thus usually requires probabilistic methods for analysis. Drawing on techniques from statistical modeling and machine learning we review recent methods for extracting important variables that quantitatively describe how sensory information is encoded in neural activity. In particular we discuss methods for estimating receptive fields modeling neural population dynamics and inferring low dimensional latent structure from a population of neurons in the context of both electrophysiology and calcium imaging data.
