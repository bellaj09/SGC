There are great physical and cognitive benefits for older adults who are engaged in active aging a process that should involve daily exercise. In our previous work on the PHysical Assistant RObot System PHAROS we developed a system that proposed and monitored physical activities. The system used a social robot to analyse by means of computer vision the exercise a person was doing. Then a recommender system analysed the exercise performed and indicated what exercise to perform next. However the system needed certain improvements. On the one hand the vision system captured the movement of the person and indicated whether the exercise had been done correctly or not. On the other hand the recommender system was based purely on a ranking system that did not take into account temporal evolution and preferences. In this work we propose an evolution of PHAROS PHAROS 2.0 incorporating improvements in both of the previously mentioned aspects. In the motion capture aspect we are now able to indicate the degree of completeness of each exercise identifying the part that has not been done correctly and a real-time performance correction. In this way the recommender system receives a greater amount of information and so can more accurately indicate the exercise to be performed. In terms of the recommender system an algorithm was developed to weigh the performance temporal evolution and preferences providing a more accurate recommendation as well as expanding the recommendation to a batch of exercises instead of just one.
