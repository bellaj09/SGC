"Simulation is firmly established as a mainstay of clinical education and extensive research has demonstrated its value. Current practice uses inanimate simulators with a range of complexity sophistication and cost to address the patient as body and trained actors or lay people Simulated Patients to address the patient as person.

A close coupling with the clinical world restricts access to the facilities and practices of simulation often excluding patients families and publics. Yet such perspectives are an essential component of clinical practice." Simulation reframed.
