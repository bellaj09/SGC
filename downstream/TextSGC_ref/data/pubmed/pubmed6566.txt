Predicting novel uses for drugs using their chemical pharmacological and indication information contributes to minimizing costs and development periods. Most previous prediction methods focused on integrating the similarity and association information of drugs and diseases. However they tended to construct shallow prediction models to predict drug-associated diseases which make deeply integrating the information difficult. Further path information between drugs and diseases is important auxiliary information for association prediction while it is not deeply integrated. We present a deep learning-based method CGARDP for predicting drug-related candidate disease indications. CGARDP establishes a feature matrix by exploiting a variety of biological premises related to drugs and diseases. A novel model based on convolutional neural network CNN and gated recurrent unit GRU is constructed to learn the local and path representations for a drug-disease pair. The CNN-based framework on the left of the model learns the local representation of the drug-disease pair from their feature matrix. As the different paths have discriminative contributions to the drug-disease association prediction we construct an attention mechanism at the path level to learn the informative paths. In the right part a GRU-based framework learns the path representation based on path information between the drug and the disease. Cross-validation results indicate that CGARDP performs better than several state-of-the-art methods. Further CGARDP retrieves more real drug-disease associations in the top part of the prediction result that are of concern to biologists. Case studies on five drugs demonstrate that CGARDP can discover potential drug-related disease indications.
