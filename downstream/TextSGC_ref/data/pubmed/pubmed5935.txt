Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved great performance on various image restoration tasks. Specifically the residual dense network RDN has achieved great results on image noise reduction by cascading multiple residual dense blocks RDBs to make full use of the hierarchical feature. However the RDN only performs well in denoising on a single noise level and the computational cost of the RDN increases significantly with the increase in the number of RDBs and this only slightly improves the effect of denoising. To overcome this we propose the dynamic residual dense network DRDN a dynamic network that can selectively skip some RDBs based on the noise amount of the input image. Moreover the DRDN allows modifying the denoising strength to manually get the best outputs which can make the network more effective for real-world denoising. Our proposed DRDN can perform better than the RDN and reduces the computational cost by 40 - 50 % . Furthermore we surpass the state-of-the-art CBDNet by 1.34 dB on the real-world noise benchmark.
