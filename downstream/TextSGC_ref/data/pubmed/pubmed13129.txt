"Emergency department ED overcrowding is a global condition that severely worsens attention to patients increases clinical risks and affects hospital cost management. A correct and early prediction of EDs admission is of high value and a motivation to adopt machine learning models. However several of these studies do not consider data collected in textual form which is a feature set that contains detailed information about patients and presents great potential for medical health care improvement. To this end we propose and compare predictive models for admission that use both structured and unstructured data available at triage time. In total our dataset comprised 499853 pediatric EDs presentations with an admission rate of 5.76% of patients with age up to 18 years old observed over 3.5 years. Our best model consists of a 2-stage architecture with a deep neural network DNN to extract information from textual data followed by a gradient boosting classifier. This combined model achieved a value of 0.892 for the Area Under the Curve AUC in the test data. We highlight the importance of DNN-based text processing for better prediction since the absence of text features resulted in AUC reduction of approximately two percentage points. Also the feature importance of text was higher than that of the Manchester Triage System MTS which is a widely used risk classification protocol. These results suggest that activations from a trained DNN should be used in transfer learning setups in future studies."
