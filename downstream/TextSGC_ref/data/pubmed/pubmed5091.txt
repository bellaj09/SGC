We study the dynamical proprieties of phase synchronization and intermittent behavior of neural systems using a network of networks structure based on an experimentally obtained human connectome for healthy and Alzheimer-affected brains. We consider a network composed of 78 neural subareas subnetworks coupled with a mean-field potential scheme. Each subnetwork is characterized by a small-world topology composed of 250 bursting neurons simulated through a Rulkov model. Using the Kuramoto order parameter we demonstrate that healthy and Alzheimer-affected brains display distinct phase synchronization and intermittence properties as a function of internal and external coupling strengths. In general for the healthy case each subnetwork develops a substantial level of internal synchronization before a global stable phase-synchronization state has been established. For the unhealthy case despite the similar internal subnetwork synchronization levels we identify higher levels of global phase synchronization occurring even for relatively small internal and external coupling. Using recurrence quantification analysis namely the determinism of the mean-field potential we identify regions where the healthy and unhealthy networks depict nonstationary behavior but the results denounce the presence of a larger region or intermittent dynamics for the case of Alzheimer-affected networks. A possible theoretical explanation based on two locally stable but globally unstable states is discussed.
