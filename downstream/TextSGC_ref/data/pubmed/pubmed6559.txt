In modern manufacturing systems and industries more and more research efforts have been made in developing effective machine health monitoring systems. Among various machine health monitoring approaches data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However considering the noise varying length and irregular sampling behind sensory data this kind of sequential data cannot be fed into classication and regression models directly. Therefore previous work focuses on feature extraction/fusion methods requiring expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years which redene representation learning from raw data a deep neural network structure named Convolutional Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks CBLSTM has been designed here to address raw sensory data. CBLSTM rstly uses CNN to extract local features that are robust and informative from the sequential input. Then bi-directional LSTM is introduced to encode temporal information. Long Short-Term Memory networksLSTMs are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data and the bi-directional structure enables the capture of past and future contexts. Stacked fully-connected layers and the linear regression layer are built on top of bi-directional LSTMs to predict the target value. Here a real-life tool wear test is introduced and our proposed CBLSTM is able to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our model is able to outperform several state-of-the-art baseline methods. Learning to Monitor Machine Health with Convolutional Bi-Directional LSTM Networks.
