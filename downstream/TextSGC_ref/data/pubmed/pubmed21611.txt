"Vaccine hesitancy is an increasing and urgent global public health challenge. Medical students encounters with vaccine-hesitant parents however remain incidental and unexplored. During pre-clinical training the vaccine-hesitant parents are typically represented through impersonal text-based cases lists of their concerns and sometimes a virtual patient. However in reality vaccine-hesitant parents have many health beliefs and arguments that are accompanied with intense emotions and students remain unaware and unprepared for them. This study is an experimental pilot test in stimulating the medical students understanding of and ability to respond to vaccine-hesitant parents beliefs and questions. An arts-based video scenario and a writing exercise are used to demonstrate a rich case of vaccine hesitancy including a simulated dialogue between a parent and a student. The study invites vaccine-hesitant parents to ask questions to medical students then it incorporates these questions in a video scenario and subsequently invites the students to answer these questions as junior doctors. The study examines how the peer group discussion after the video viewing resembles a hospital breakroom conversation and how the written dialogue with a vaccine-hesitant parent simulates a consultation-room encounter."
