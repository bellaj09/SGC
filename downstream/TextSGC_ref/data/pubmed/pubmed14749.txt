"Alzheimers disease AD is characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognitive functions. Deep magnetic stimulation DMS a noninvasive and nonpharmacological brain stimulation has been reported to alleviate stress-related cognitive impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study also discovered the preventive effect of DMS on cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. However the underlying mechanism must be explored further. In this study we investigated the effect of DMS on spatial learning and memory functions neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus DG as well as expression and activity of the cholinergic system in a transgenic mouse model of AD 5XFAD. Administration of DMS effectively improved performance in spatial learning and memory of 5XFAD mice. Furthermore neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG of DMS-treated 5XFAD mice was clearly enhanced. In addition DMS significantly raised the level of acetylcholine and prevented the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the decrease in acetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. These findings indicate that DMS may be a promising noninvasive tool for treatment and prevention of AD cognitive impairment by promoting neurogenesis and enhancing cholinergic system function."
