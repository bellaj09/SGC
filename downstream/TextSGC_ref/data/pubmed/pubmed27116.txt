Brain computer interfaces BCIs enable human brains to interact directly with machines. Motor imagery based BCI MI-BCI encodes the motor intentions of human agents and provides feedback accordingly. However 15-30% of people are not able to perform vivid motor imagery. To save time and monetary resources a number of predictors have been proposed to screen for users with low BCI aptitude. While the proposed predictors provide some level of correlation with MI-BCI performance simple objective and accurate predictors are currently not available. Thus in this study we have examined the utility of a simple reaction time SRT test for predicting MI-BCI performance. We enrolled 10 subjects and measured their motor imagery performance with either visual or proprioceptive feedback. Their reaction time was also measured using a SRT test. The results show a significant negative correlation r  -0.67 between SRT and MI-BCI performance. Therefore SRT may be used as a simple and reliable predictor of MI-BCI performance.
