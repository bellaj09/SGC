Passiveand imagined limbmovements induce changes in cerebral oscillatory activity. Central modulatory effects play a role in plastic changes and are of uttermost importance in rehabilitation. This has extensively been studied for upper limb but less is known for lower limb. The aim of this study is to investigate the topographical distribution of event-related desynchronization/synchronizationERD/ERS and task-relatedcoherence during a robot-assisted and a motor imagery task of lower limb in healthy subjects to inform rehabilitation paradigms. 32-channels electroencephalogram EEG was recorded in twenty-one healthy right footed and handed subjects during a robot-assisted single-joint cyclic right ankle movement performed by the BTS ANYMOV robotic hospital bed. Data were acquired with a block protocol for passive and imagined movement at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. ERD/ERS and task related coherence were calculated in alpha1 8-10 Hz alpha2 10.5-12.5 Hz and beta 13-30 Hz frequency ranges. During passive movement alpha2 rhythm desynchronized overC3 and ipsilateral frontal areas F4 FC2 FC6; betaERD was detected over the bilateral motor areas Cz C3 C4. During motor imagery a significant desynchronization was evident for alpha1 over contralateral sensorimotor cortex C3 for alpha2 over bilateral motor areas C3 and C4 and for beta over central scalp areas. Task-related coherence decreased during passive movement in alpha2 band between contralateral central area C3 CP5 CP1 P3 and ipsilateral frontal area F8 FC6 T8; beta band coherence decreased between C3-C4 electrodes and increased between C3-Cz. These data contribute to the understanding of oscillatory activity and functional neuronal interactions during lower limb robot-assisted motor performance. The final output of this line of research is to inform the design and development of neurorehabilitation protocols. Quantitative EEG Evaluation During Robot-Assisted Foot Movement.
