Single crystal silicon carbide SiC is a wide band-gap semiconductor which has shown both bio- and hemo-compatibility 1-5. Although single crystalline SiC has appealing bio-sensing potential the material has not been extensively characterized. Cubic silicon carbide 3C-SiC has superior in vitro biocompatibility compared to its hexagonal counterparts 3 5. Brain machine interface BMI systems using implantable neuronal prosthetics offer the possibility of bi-directional signaling which allow sensory feedback and closed loop control. Existing implantable neural interfaces have limited long-term reliability and 3C-SiC may be a material that may improve that reliability. In the present study we investigated in vivo 3C-SiC biocompatibility in the CNS of C56BL/6 mice. 3C-SiC was compared against the known immunoreactive response of silicon Si at 5 10 and 35 days. The material was examined to detect CD45 a protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP expressed by activated microglia and macrophages. The 3C-SiC surface revealed limited immunoresponse and significantly reduced microglia compared to Si substrate.
