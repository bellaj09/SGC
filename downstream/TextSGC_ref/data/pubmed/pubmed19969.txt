The paper approaches a new technological scenario relevant for the introduction of the digital cytology D-CYT in the health service. A detailed analysis of the state of the art on the status of the introduction of D-CYT in the hospital and more in general in the dispersed territory has been conducted. The analysis was conducted in a form of review and was arranged into two parts: the first part focused on the technological tools needed to carry out a successful service client server architectures e-learning quality assurance issues; the second part focused on issues oriented to help the introduction and evaluation of the technology specific training in D-CYT health technology assessment in-routine application data format standards and picture archiving computerized systems PACS implementation image quality assessment strategies of navigation 3D-virtual-reality potentialities. The work enlightens future scenarios of actions relevant for the introduction of the technology. Virtual microscopy and digital cytology: state of the art.
