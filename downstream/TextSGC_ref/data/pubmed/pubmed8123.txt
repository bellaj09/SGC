"Industry 4.0 leaders solve problems all of the time. Successful problem-solving behavioral pattern choice determines organizational and personal success therefore a proper understanding of the problem-solving-related neurological dynamics is sure to help increase business performance. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first to discover relevant neurological characteristics of problem-solving behavioral patterns and second to conduct a characterization of two problem-solving behavioral patterns with the aid of deep-learning architectures. This is done by combining electroencephalographic non-invasive sensors that capture process owners brain activity signals and a deep-learning soft sensor that performs an accurate characterization of such signals with an accuracy rate of over 99% in the presented case-study dataset. As a result the deep-learning characterization of lean management LM problem-solving behavioral patterns is expected to help Industry 4.0 leaders in their choice of adequate manufacturing systems and their related problem-solving methods in their future pursuit of strategic organizational goals."
