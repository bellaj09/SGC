"Intracortical brain-computer interfaces iBCIs decode intended movement from neural activity for the control of external devices such as a robotic arm. Standard approaches include a calibration phase to estimate decoding parameters. During iBCI operation the statistical properties of the neural activity can depart from those observed during calibration sometimes hindering a users ability to control the iBCI. To address this problem we adaptively correct the offset terms within a Kalman filter decoder via penalized maximum likelihood estimation. The approach can handle rapid shifts in neural signal behavior on the order of seconds and requires no knowledge of the intended movement. The algorithm called multiple offset correction algorithm MOCA was tested using simulated neural activity and evaluated retrospectively using data collected from two people with tetraplegia operating an iBCI. In 19 clinical research test cases where a nonadaptive Kalman filter yielded relatively high decoding errors MOCA significantly reduced these errors  10.6  10.1% ; p < 0.05 pairwise t-test. MOCA did not significantly change the error in the remaining 23 cases where a nonadaptive Kalman filter already performed well. These results suggest that MOCA provides more robust decoding than the standard Kalman filter for iBCIs." Adaptive offset correction for intracortical brain-computer interfaces.
