"Brain-computer interface BCI has proven to be a useful tool for providing alternative communication and mobility to patients suffering from nervous system injury. BCI has been and will continue to be implemented into rehabilitation practices for more interactive and speedy neurological recovery. The most exciting BCI technology is evolving to provide therapeutic benefits by inducing cortical reorganization via neuronal plasticity. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of BCI technology used after nervous system injuries specifically: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Parkinsons disease spinal cord injury stroke and disorders of consciousness. Also presented is transcending innovative research involving new treatment of neurological disorders." Brain-computer interface after nervous system injury.
