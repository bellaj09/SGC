"When combined with assistive robotic devices such as wearable robotics brain/neural-computer interfaces BNCI have the potential to restore the capabilities of handicapped people to carry out activities of daily living. To improve applicability of such systems workload and stress should be reduced to a minimal level. Here we investigated the users physiological reactions during the exhaustive use of the interfaces of a hybrid control interface. Eleven BNCI-naive healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. All participants sat in a comfortable chair in front of a desk and wore a whole-arm exoskeleton as well as wearable devices for monitoring physiological electroencephalographic EEG and electrooculographic EoG signals. The experimental protocol consisted of three phases: i Set-up calibration and BNCI training; ii Familiarization phase; and iii Experimental phase during which each subject had to perform EEG and EoG tasks. After completing each task the NASA-TLX questionnaire and self-assessment manikin SAM were completed by the user. We found significant differences p-value < 0.05 in heart rate variability HRV and skin conductance level SCL between participants during the use of the two different biosignal modalities EEG EoG of the BNCI. This indicates that EEG control is associated with a higher level of stress associated with a decrease in HRV and mental work load associated with a higher level of SCL when compared to EoG control. In addition HRV and SCL modulations correlated with the subjects workload perception and emotional responses assessed through NASA-TLX questionnaires and SAM."
