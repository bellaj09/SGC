This study was conducted to analyze the short-term effects of violent electronic games played with or without a virtual reality VR device on the instigation of aggressive behavior. Physiological arousal heart rate HR priming of aggressive thoughts and state hostility were also measured to test their possible mediation on the relationship between playing the violent game VG and aggression. The participants--148 undergraduate students--were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: two groups played a violent computer game Unreal Tournament and the other two a non-violent game Motocross Madness half with a VR device and the remaining participants on the computer screen. In order to assess the game effects the following instruments were used: a BIOPAC System MP100 to measure HR an Emotional Stroop task to analyze the priming of aggressive and fear thoughts a self-report State Hostility Scale to measure hostility and a competitive reaction-time task to assess aggressive behavior. The main results indicated that the violent computer game had effects on state hostility and aggression. Although no significant mediation effect could be detected regression analyses showed an indirect effect of state hostility between playing a VG and aggression. Are the effects of Unreal violent video games pronounced when playing with a virtual reality system?
