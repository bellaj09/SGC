Background: Post-stroke survivors with right hemisphere injury have more impairments in postural control and balance. However the impact of the hemisphere injured on the process of balance reacquisition has not been fully explored. We hypothesized that stroke survivors could learn balance tasks H1 but right hemisphere damaged patients would show poor motor learning if compared to left hemisphere damaged patients H2Objective: To investigate whether the brain-damaged side after stroke affects the learning of a balance task. Methods: Three groups were recruited: twenty stroke survivors ten left and ten right hemisphere damage and twenty healthy volunteers. The participants practiced a balance task for thirty minutes four consecutive days. The task was the Table Tilt game NintendoTM Company which induces balance demands with a progression of complexity. Motor performance was assessed at baseline post-practice and after one week retention test. Accuracy errors and complexity of the task achieved during the trial were assessedResults: Participants in all groups improved their performance p <\xa0.001 and maintained it at the retention test. The control group showed better performance if compared to the right and left hemisphere damaged stroke survivors p <\xa0.05. There was no difference between individuals with right and left hemisphere damaged but the right hemisphere damaged patients demonstrated more errors at higher levels of complexityConclusion: Stroke survivors can learn balance tasks H1 and the right hemisphere damaged patients demonstrate more errors than those with left hemisphere injury in higher complexity conditions H2. Effects of the brain-damaged side after stroke on the learning of a balance task in a non-immersive virtual reality environment.
