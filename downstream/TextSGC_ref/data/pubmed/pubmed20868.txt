Studies on behavior control are important for bio-robots designation. For auto or manual navigation of the bio-robots the accuracy of the command execution is especially critical. In this paper we reported a precise "STOP" command for the rat-robots by optical stimulation of the central nervous system CNS. We labeled dorsolateral periaqueductal gray dlPAG neurons with light sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 ChR2 and directly probed the optical fiber to reactivate these neurons. The rats showed freezing behavior only upon the optical stimulation with an appropriate range of laser intensity and stimulation frequency. Neuron spikes and local field potential LFP were simultaneously recorded with optical stimulation by optrodes on free moving rat-robots. Together our findings demonstrated the utility of deep brain optical stimulation for the stopping behavior of rat-robot control and indicated a potential application of optogenetics for precise control of bio-robots in further work. Encode the "STOP" command by photo-stimulation for precise control of rat-robot.
