"There is now a substantial literature investigating virtual reality exposure therapy VRET as a viable treatment option for anxiety disorders. In this meta-analysis we provide effect size estimates for virtual reality treatment in comparison to in vivo exposure and control conditions waitlist attention control etc.. A comprehensive search of the literature identified 13 studies n=397 that were included in the final analyses. Consistent with prediction the primary random effects analysis showed a large mean effect size for VRET compared to control conditions Cohens d=1.11 S.E.=0.15 95% CI: 0.82-1.39. This finding was consistent across secondary outcome categories as well domain-specific general subjective distress cognition behavior and psychophysiology. Also as expected in vivo treatment was not significantly more effective than VRET. In fact there was a small effect size favoring VRET over in vivo conditions Cohens d=0.35 S.E.=0.15 95% CI: 0.05-0.65. There was a trend for a dose-response relationship with more VRET sessions showing larger effects p=0.06. Outcome was not related to publication year or sample size. Implications are discussed."
