"This study evaluated an intervention for people with aphasia delivered in a novel virtual reality platform called EVA Park. EVA Park contains a number of functional and fantastic locations and allows for interactive communication between multiple users. Twenty people with aphasia had 5 weeks intervention during which they received daily language stimulation sessions in EVA Park from a support worker. The study employed a quasi randomised design which compared a group that received immediate intervention with a waitlist control group. Outcome measures explored the effects of intervention on communication and language skills communicative confidence and feelings of social isolation. Compliance with the intervention was also explored through attrition and usage data." Evaluating the Benefits of Aphasia Intervention Delivered in Virtual Reality: Results of a Quasi-Randomised Study.
