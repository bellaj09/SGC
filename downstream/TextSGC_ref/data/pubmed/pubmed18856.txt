Immersive journalism in the form of virtual reality VR headsets and 360-video is becoming more mainstream and is much touted for inducing greater "presence" than traditional text. But does this presence influence psychological outcomes of reading news such as memory for story content perceptions of credibility and empathy felt toward story characters? We propose that two key technological affordances of VR modality and interactivity are responsible for triggering three presence-related cognitive heuristics being-there interaction and realism which influence news readers\ memory and their perceptions of credibility empathy and story-sharing intentions. We report a 3 storytelling medium: VR vs. 360-video vs. Text\u2009\u20092 story: "The displaced" and "The click effect" mixed-factorial experiment in which participants N\u2009=\u2009129 experienced two New York Times stories that differed in their emotional intensity using one of the three mediums VR 360-video Text. Participants who experienced the stories using VR and 360-video outperformed those who read the same stories using text with pictures not only on such presence-related outcomes as being-there interaction and realism but also on perceived source credibility story-sharing intention and feelings of empathy. Moreover we found that senses of being-there interaction and realism mediated the relationship between storytelling medium and reader perceptions of credibility story recall and story-sharing intention. These findings have theoretical implications for the psychology of virtual reality and practical applications for immersive journalism in particular and interactive media in general.
