The cannabinoid 1 receptor CB1 R is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the brain and plays crucial roles in emotion and behavior by modulating or mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity. Differences in CB1 R density between male and female rodents may be associated with distinct behavioral phenotypes. In the rat brain CB1 R expression is significantly lower in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of estrus females than in males. However differences in CB1 R distribution due to sex over the whole mouse brain are still largely unknown. Here we systemically investigated the expression of CB1 R mRNA in the brains of both male and female adult C57BL/6J mice using fluorescence in situ hybridization. There were significantly more CB1 R positive cells in males than in females in the orbital cortex insular cortex cingulate cortex piriform cortex secondary visual cortex caudate putamen striatum and ventral hippocampal CA1. There were significantly more CB1 R mRNA cells in females than males in the fornix and dorsal hypothalamus. However in some regions strong hybridization signals without sex differences were detected such as in the motor cortex septum medial habenular nucleus and inferior colliculus. Moreover female mice displayed different CB1 R mRNA expression patterns in the medial amygdala basolateral amygdala and parabrachial nucleus during different phases of the estrous cycle. These findings provide a basis for understanding sexual dimorphism in physiological and pathological brain functions related to CB1 R.
