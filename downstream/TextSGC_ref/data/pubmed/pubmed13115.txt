Fundamental aspects of brain function including development plasticity learning and memory can take place over time scales of days to years. Chronic in vivo imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution is a powerful method for tracking the long-term activity of neural circuits. We review recent advances in our understanding of neural circuit function from diverse brain regions that have been enabled by chronic in vivo cellular imaging. Insight into the neural basis of learning and decision-making in particular benefit from the ability to acquire longitudinal data from genetically identified neuronal populations deep brain areas and subcellular structures. We propose that combining chronic imaging with further experimental and computational innovations will advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms of brain function.
