Chemical-chemical interaction CCI plays a major role in predicting candidate drugs toxicities therapeutic effects and biological functions. CCI is typically inferred from a variety of information; however CCI has yet not been predicted using a learning-based approach. In other drug analyses deep learning has been actively used in recent years. However in most cases deep learning has been used only for classification even though it has feature extraction capabilities. Thus in this paper we propose an end-to-end representation learning method for CCI named DeepCCI which includes feature extraction and a learning-based approach. Our proposed architecture is based on the Siamese network. Hidden representations are extracted from a simplified molecular input line entry system SMILES which is a string notation representing the chemical structure using weight-shared convolutional neural networks. Subsequently L1 element-wise distances between the two extracted hidden representations are measured. The performance of DeepCCI is compared with those of 12 fingerprint-method combinations. The proposed DeepCCI shows the best performance in most of the evaluation metrics used. In addition DeepCCI was experimentally validated to guarantee the commutative property. The automatically extracted features can alleviate the efforts required for manual feature engineering and improve prediction performance.
