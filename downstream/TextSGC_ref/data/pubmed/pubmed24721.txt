Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs based on auditory selective attention have been receiving much attention because i they are useful for completely paralyzed users since they do not require muscular effort or gaze and ii focusing attention is a natural human ability. Several techniques - such as recently developed Spatial Coherence SC - have been proposed in order to optimize the BCI procedure. Thus this work aims at investigating and comparing two strategies based on spatial coherence detection: contralateral and modular classifiers. The latter is a new method using modular attention index. The new classifier was developed to implement an auditory BCI where a volunteer makes binary choices using selective attention under the amplitude-modulated tones stimulation. Classification of auditory selective attention using spatial coherence and modular attention index.
