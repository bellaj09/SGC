Data augmentation is an important strategy for enlarging training datasets in deep learning-based medical image analysis. This is because large annotated medical datasets are not only difficult and costly to generate but also quickly become obsolete due to rapid advances in imaging technology. Image-to-image conditional generative adversarial networks C-GAN provide a potential solution for data augmentation. However annotations used as inputs to C-GAN are typically based only on shape information which can result in undesirable intensity distributions in the resulting artificially-created images. In this paper we introduce an active cell appearance model ACAM that can measure statistical distributions of shape and intensity and use this ACAM model to guide C-GAN to generate more realistic images which we call A-GAN. A-GAN provides an effective means for conveying anisotropic intensity information to C-GAN. A-GAN incorporates a statistical model ACAM to determine how transformations are applied for data augmentation. Traditional approaches for data augmentation that are based on arbitrary transformations might lead to unrealistic shape variations in an augmented dataset that are not representative of real data. A-GAN is designed to ameliorate this. To validate the effectiveness of using A-GAN for data augmentation we assessed its performance on cell analysis in adaptive optics retinal imaging which is a rapidly-changing medical imaging modality. Compared to C-GAN A-GAN achieved stability in fewer iterations. The cell detection and segmentation accuracy when assisted by A-GAN augmentation was higher than that achieved with C-GAN. These findings demonstrate the potential for A-GAN to substantially improve existing data augmentation methods in medical image analysis.
