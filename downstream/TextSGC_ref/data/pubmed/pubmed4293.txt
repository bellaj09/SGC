Cerebral asymmetry is considered an important marker of the successful development of the human brain. Recent studies have demonstrated topological asymmetries between structurally hemispheric networks in the human brain. However it remains largely unknown whether and how the functionally topological asymmetries evolve from childhood to adulthood a critical period that constitutes the primary peak of human brain and cognitive development. Here we adopted resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging data to construct hemispheric functional networks and then applied graph theory analysis to quantify the topological characteristics of the hemispheric networks. We found that the adult group exhibited consistent leftward hemispheric asymmetries in both global and local network efficiency and the degree of leftward asymmetry in local network efficiency was significantly increased with development from childhood to adulthood. At the nodal level the degree of leftward asymmetry in nodal efficiency mainly involving the frontal parietal-occipital junction and occipital regions increased with development. These developmental patterns of topological asymmetries suggest that the protracted maturation of functional segregation in the left hemisphere could underlie language development from childhood to adulthood and provide insight into the development of human brain functional networks. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy evidence for the development of topological asymmetry between hemispheric brain networks from childhood to adulthood.
