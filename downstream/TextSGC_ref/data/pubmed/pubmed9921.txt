"Parkinsons Disease PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that manifests through slowly progressing symptoms such as tremor voice degradation and bradykinesia. Automated detection of such symptoms has recently received much attention by the research community owing to the clinical benefits associated with the early diagnosis of the disease. Unfortunately most of the approaches proposed so far operate under a strictly laboratory setting thus limiting their potential applicability in real world conditions. In this work we present a method for automatically detecting tremorous episodes related to PD based on acceleration signals. We propose to address the problem at hand as a case of Multiple-Instance Learning wherein a subject is represented as an unordered bag of signal segments and a single expert-provided ground-truth. We employ a deep learning approach that combines feature learning and a learnable pooling stage and is trainable end-to-end. Results on a newly introduced dataset of accelerometer signals collected in-the-wild confirm the validity of the proposed approach."
