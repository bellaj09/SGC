Episodic memory depends on the maintenance of an intact default mode network DMN and is one of the earliest cognitive domains to become impaired in type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM. Therefore exploring the alterations in task-related DMN deactivation and functional connectivity that affect episodic memory in T2DM will help to enhance our understanding of the allocation patterns underlying memory function in T2DM. Dysfunctional organization of default mode network before memory impairments in type 2 diabetes.
