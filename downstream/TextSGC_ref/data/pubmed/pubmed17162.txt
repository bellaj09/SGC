"Freezing of gait FOG is a common disabling symptom of Parkinsons disease PD that is associated with deficits in motor initiation and inhibition. Understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited by difficulties in eliciting and objectively characterizing such gait phenomena in the clinical setting. However recent work suggests that virtual reality VR techniques might offer the potential to study motor control. This study utilized a VR paradigm to explore deficits in motor initiation and stopping performance including stop failure in PD patients with Freezers 31 and without Non-Freezers 23 FOG and healthy age-matched Controls 15. The VR task required subjects to respond to a series of start and stop cues while navigating a corridor using ankle flexion/extension movements on foot pedals. We found that Freezers experienced slower motor output initiation and more frequent start hesitations SHs initiations greater than twice a subjects usual initiation latency compared to Non-Freezers and Controls. Freezers also showed more marked inhibitory impairments taking significantly longer to execute motor inhibition and experiencing an increased frequency of failed stopping in response to stop cues compared to Non-Freezers and Controls. Stopping impairments were exacerbated by stop cues requiring additional cognitive processing. These results suggest that PD patients with FOG have marked impairments in motor initiation and inhibition that are not prominent in patients without FOG nor healthy controls. Future work combining such VR paradigms with neuroimaging techniques and intra-operative deep brain recordings may increase our understanding of these phenomena promoting the development of novel technologies and therapeutic approaches."
