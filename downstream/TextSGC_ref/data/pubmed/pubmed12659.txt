Sleep spindles are significant transient oscillations observed on the electroencephalogram EEG in stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Deep belief network DBN gaining great successes in images and speech is still a novel method to develop sleep spindle detection system. In this paper crowdsourcing replacing gold standard was applied to generate three different labeled samples and constructed three classes of datasets with a combination of these samples. An F1-score measure was estimated to compare the performance of DBN to other three classifiers on classifying these samples with the DBN obtaining an result of 92.78%. Then a comparison of two feature extraction methods based on power spectrum density was made on same dataset using DBN. In addition the DBN trained in dataset was applied to detect sleep spindle from raw EEG recordings and performed a comparable capacity to expert group consensus.
