Emerging evidence has shown that RNA plays a crucial role in many cellular processes and their biological functions are primarily achieved by binding with a variety of proteins. High-throughput biological experiments provide a lot of valuable information for the initial identification of RNA-protein interactions RPIs but with the increasing complexity of RPIs networks this method gradually falls into expensive and time-consuming situations. Therefore there is an urgent need for high speed and reliable methods to predict RNA-protein interactions. In this study we propose a computational method for predicting the RNA-protein interactions using sequence information. The deep learning convolution neural network CNN algorithm is utilized to mine the hidden high-level discriminative features from the RNA and protein sequences and feed it into the extreme learning machine ELM classifier. The experimental results with 5-fold cross-validation indicate that the proposed method achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets RPI1807 RPI2241 and RPI369 with the accuracy of 98.83% 90.83% and 85.63% respectively. We further evaluate the performance of the proposed model by comparing it with the state-of-the-art SVM classifier and other existing methods on the same benchmark data set. The experimental results show our model can serve as a useful tool for predicting RNA-protein interactions.
