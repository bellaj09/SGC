"Complex geometric variations of 3D models usually pose great challenges in 3D shape matching and retrieval. In this paper we propose a novel 3D shape feature learning method to extract high-level shape features that are insensitive to geometric deformations of shapes. Our method uses a discriminative deep auto-encoder to learn deformation-invariant shape features. First a multiscale shape distribution is computed and used as input to the auto-encoder. We then impose the Fisher discrimination criterion on the neurons in the hidden layer to develop a deep discriminative auto-encoder. Finally the outputs from the hidden layers of the discriminative auto-encoders at different scales are concatenated to form the shape descriptor. The proposed method is evaluated on four benchmark datasets that contain 3D models with large geometric variations: McGill SHREC10 ShapeGoogle SHREC14 Human and SHREC14 Large Scale Comprehensive Retrieval Track Benchmark datasets. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for 3D shape retrieval." DeepShape: Deep-Learned Shape Descriptor for 3D Shape Retrieval.
