"In this study we describe and analyze the ways in which high school students explored a virtual solar system VSS. VSS is a nonimmersive virtual environment that affords visual manipulations of space by altering its frame of reference. The Observer software was used to code and analyze the participants real-time free-exploration task. Two basic behaviors were identified across participants: establishing several home bases and shifting between a still mode and a dynamic mode. Moreover three overall exploration patterns emerged: the butterfly pattern represents a superficial mode of learning; the bee pattern represents an in-depth mode of studying the various celestial objects; and the eagle pattern represents a global approach of studying the complex system. This virtual reality environment promises to provide a setting in which to further study consistent patterns and individual differences in exploration strategies."
