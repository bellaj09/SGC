"Measurements of the extreme ultraviolet EUV solar spectral irradiance SSI are essential for understanding drivers of space weather effects such as radio blackouts and aerodynamic drag on satellites during periods of enhanced solar activity. In this paper we show how to learn a mapping from EUV narrowband images to spectral irradiance measurements using data from NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory obtained between 2010 to 2014. We describe a protocol and baselines for measuring the performance of models. Our best performing machine learning ML model based on convolutional neural networks CNNs outperforms other ML models and a differential emission measure DEM based approach yielding average relative errors of under 4.6% maximum error over emission lines and more typically 1.6% median. We also provide evidence that the proposed method is solving this mapping in a way that makes physical sense and by paying attention to magnetic structures known to drive EUV SSI variability."
