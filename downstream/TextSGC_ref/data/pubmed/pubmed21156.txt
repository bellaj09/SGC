Steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs have potential to provide a fast communication channel between human brain and external devices. In SSVEP-based BCIs Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA has been widely used to detect frequency-coded SSVEPs due to its high efficiency and robustness. However the detectability of SSVEPs differs among frequencies due to a power-law distribution of the power spectra of spontaneous electroencephalogram EEG signals. This study proposed a new method based on the fact that changes of canonical correlation coefficients for SSVEPs and background EEG signals follow the same trend along frequency. The proposed method defined a normalized canonical correlation coefficient the ratio of the canonical correlation coefficient for SSVEPs to the mean of the canonical correlation coefficients for background EEG signals to enhance the frequency detection of SSVEPs. An SSVEP dataset from 13 subjects was used for comparing classification performance between the proposed method and the standard CCA method. Classification accuracy and simulated information transfer rates ITR suggest that in an unsupervised way the proposed method could considerably improve the frequency detection accuracy of SSVEPs with little computational effort. Enhancing unsupervised canonical correlation analysis-based frequency detection of SSVEPs by incorporating background EEG.
