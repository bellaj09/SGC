In recent years machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to analysis of patient symptom data in the context of disease diagnosis at least where such data is well codified. However much of the data present in Electronic Health Records EHR is unlikely to prove suitable for classic machine learning approaches. In particular the use of free or unstructured text for clinical notes presents significant analytical opportunities but also unique difficulties. Furthermore the wide dispersal of health data relating to individuals necessitates the development of decentralized solutions. We provide in this paper an overview of our approach to develop a neural network framework for patient classification in the environment of EHRs where data may be heterogeneous incomplete containing missing values and noisy. In this paper we describe our system which provides prediction of outlier cases which are likely to relate to frequent attender patients which acheives an Area-Under-the-Curve score of up to 0.92.
