Tracing the use of computers in the radiology department from administrative functions through image acquisition storage and reporting to early attempts at improved diagnosis we begin to imagine possible new frontiers for their use in exam interpretation. Given their initially slow but ultimately substantial progress in the noninterpretive areas we are left desiring and even expecting more in the interpretation realm. New technological advances may provide the next wave of progress and radiologists should be early adopters. Several potential applications are discussed and hopefully will serve to inspire future progress. "Artificial intelligence and deep learning - Radiologys next frontier?"
