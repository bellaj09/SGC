Motivation: N4-methylcytosine 4mC plays an important role in host defense and transcriptional regulation. Accurate identification of 4mc sites provides a more comprehensive understanding of its biological effects. At present the traditional machine learning algorithms are used in the research on 4mC sites prediction but the complexity of the algorithms is relatively high which is not suitable for the processing of large data sets and the accuracy of prediction needs to be improved. Therefore it is necessary to develop a new and effective method to accurately identify 4mC sites. Results: In this work we found a large number of 4mC sites and non 4mC sites of Caenorhabditis elegans C. elegans from the latest MethSMRT website which greatly expanded the dataset of C. elegans and developed a hybrid deep neural network framework named 4mcDeep-CBI aiming to identify 4mC sites. In order to obtain the high latitude information of the feature we input the preliminary extracted features into the Convolutional Neural Network CNN and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network BLSTM to generate advanced features. Taking the advanced features as algorithm input we have proposed an integrated algorithm to improve feature representation. Experimental results on large new dataset show that the proposed predictor is able to achieve generally better performance in identifying 4mC sites as compared to the state-of-art predictor. Notably this is the first study of identifying 4mC sites using deep neural network. Moreover our model runs much faster than the state-of-art predictor.
