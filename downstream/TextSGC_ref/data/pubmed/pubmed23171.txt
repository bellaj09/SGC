"Social skills training SST intervention has shown its efficacy to improve social dysfunction in patients with psychosis; however the implementation of new skills into patients everyday functioning is difficult to achieve. In this study we report results from the application of a virtual reality VR integrated program as an adjunct technique to a brief social skills intervention for patients with schizophrenia. It was predicted that the intervention would improve social cognition and performance of patients as well as generalisation of the learned responses into patients daily life." A virtual reality-integrated program for improving social skills in patients with schizophrenia: a pilot study.
