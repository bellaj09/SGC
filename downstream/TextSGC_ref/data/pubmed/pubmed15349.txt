"Machine learning algorithms can be trained to estimate age from brain structural MRI. The difference between an individuals predicted and chronological age predicted age difference PAD is a phenotype of relevance to aging and brain disease. Here we present a new deep learning approach to predict brain age from a T1-weighted MRI. The method was trained on a dataset of healthy Icelanders and tested on two datasets IXI and UK Biobank utilizing transfer learning to improve accuracy on new sites. A genome-wide association study GWAS of PAD in the UK Biobank data discovery set: Formula: see text replication set: Formula: see text yielded two sequence variants rs1452628-T Formula: see text Formula: see text and rs2435204-G Formula: see text Formula: see text. The former is near KCNK2 and correlates with reduced sulcal width whereas the latter correlates with reduced white matter surface area and tags a well-known inversion at 17q21.31 H2." Brain age prediction using deep learning uncovers associated sequence variants.
