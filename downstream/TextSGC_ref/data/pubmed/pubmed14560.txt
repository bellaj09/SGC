Comparing the key determinants of health articulated by the Public Health Agency of Canada the Agency with the spiritual and cultural knowledge systems of First Nations peoples as expressed by the Four Worlds International Institute for Human and Community Development Four Worlds and their 14 determinants of well-being and health reveals differing philosophical perspectives. The key determinants of health can be interpreted as lacking a holistic and inclusive approach to public health services. As a result many public health programs in Canada marginalize ignore and suppress the needs of First Nations communities and people. Incorporating the Four Worlds guiding principles and its 14 health determinants model within the context of Canadian public health services geared towards First Nations populations provides the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of social determinants of health. Therefore when implementing public health initiatives to address the health status of First Nations people in Canada it is important that the Agency incorporate the guiding principles of the Four Worlds: Development Comes from Within; No Vision No Development; Individual and Community Transformations Must Go Hand in Hand; and Holistic Learning is the Key to Deep and Lasting Change. Reconceptualizing the key determinants of health to encompass the worldview expressed by the Four Worlds acknowledges the cultural wisdom of First Nations people and offers the potential to develop more inclusive public health services.
