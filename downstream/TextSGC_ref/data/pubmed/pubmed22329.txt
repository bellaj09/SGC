Technical proficiency in carotid artery stent CAS procedures is paramount to ensure patient safety. If virtual reality VR simulation is to be used as a valid means for credentialing physicians for CAS procedures the assessment parameters must be able to evaluate the performance during CAS and to differentiate level of CAS experience. The aim of this study was to validate assessment parameters of a commercially available VR simulator VIST Vascular Interventional Surgical Trainer Mentice Gothenburg Sweden during a CAS procedure in experienced interventionalists. Virtual reality simulation objectively differentiates level of carotid stent experience in experienced interventionalists.
