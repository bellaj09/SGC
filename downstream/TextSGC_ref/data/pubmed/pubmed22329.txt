Biomedical engineering technologies such as brain-machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics are advancements which assist human beings in varied ways. There are exciting yet speculative visions of how the neurosciences and bioengineering may influence human nature. However these could be preparing a possible pathway towards an enhanced and even posthuman future. This article seeks to investigate several ethical themes and wider questions of enhancement transhumanism and posthumanism. Four themes of interest are: autonomy identity futures and community. Three larger questions can be asked: will everyone be enhanced? Will we be "human" if we are not one\xa0day transhuman? Should we be enhanced or not? The article proceeds by concentrating on a widespread and sometimes controversial application: the cochlear implant an auditory prosthesis implanted into Deaf patients. Cochlear implantation and its reception in both the deaf and hearing communities have a distinctive moral discourse which can offer surprising insights. The paper begins with several points about the enhancement of human beings transhumanism\s reach beyond the human and posthuman aspirations. Next it focuses on cochlear implants on two sides. Firstly a shorter consideration of what technologies may do to humans in a transhumanist world. Secondly a deeper analysis of cochlear implantation\s unique socio-political movement its ethical explanations and cultural experiences linked with pediatric cochlear implantation-and how those wary of being thrust towards posthumanism could marshal such ideas by analogy. As transhumanism approaches the issues and questions merit continuing intense analysis. Cochlear Implantation Enhancements Transhumanism and Posthumanism: Some Human Questions.
