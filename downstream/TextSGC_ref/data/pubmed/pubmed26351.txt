"A brain-computer interface BCI aims to establish communication between the human brain and a computing system so as to enable the interaction between an individual and his environment without using the brain output pathways. Individuals control a BCI system by modulating their brain signals through mental tasks e.g. motor imagery or mental calculation or sensory stimulation e.g. auditory visual or tactile. As users modulate their brain signals at different frequencies and at different levels the appropriate characterization of those signals is necessary. The modulation of brain signals through mental tasks is furthermore a skill that requires training. Unfortunately not all the users acquire such skill. A practical solution to this problem is to assess the user probability of controlling a BCI system. Another possible solution is to set the bandwidth of the brain oscillations which is highly sensitive to the users age sex and anatomy. With this in mind NeuroIndex a Python executable script estimates a neurophysiological prediction index and the individual alpha frequency IAF of the user in question. These two parameters are useful to characterize the user EEG signals and decide how to go through the complex process of adapting the human brain and the computing system on the basis of previously proposed methods. NeuroIndeX is not only the implementation of those methods but it also complements the methods each other and provides an alternative way to obtain the prediction parameter. However an important limitation of this application is its dependency on the IAF value and some results should be interpreted with caution. The script along with some electroencephalographic datasets are available on a GitHub repository in order to corroborate the functionality and usability of this application."
