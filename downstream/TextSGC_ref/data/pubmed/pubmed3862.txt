"Parkinsons disease PD is a chronic and progressive movement disorder of the central nervous system characterized by widespread alterations in several non-motor aspects such as mood sleep olfactory and cognition in addition to motor dysfunctions. Advanced neuroimaging using functional connectivity reconstruction of the human brain has provided a vast knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder but this however does not cover the overall inter-/intra-individual variability of PD phenotypes. The present review is aimed at discussing to what extent the evidence provided by group-based neuroimaging analysis in this field of study using seed-based network-based or graph theory approaches may be generalized. In particular we summarized the literature on the application of resting-state functional connectivity studies to explore different neural correlates of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and the neural mechanisms involved in treatment effects: effects of levodopa or deep brain stimulation. The lesson learnt from one decade of studies provides consistent evidence on the role of the altered communication between the striato-frontal pathways as a marker of PD-related motor degeneration whereas in the non-motor domain several missing pieces of a complex puzzle are provided. However the main target is to present a new era of intelligent neuroimaging applications where automated multivariate analysis of functional connectivity data may be used for moving from group-level statistical results to personalized predictions in a clinical setting. Although in its relative infancy the evidence gathered so far suggests a new era of clinical neuroimaging is starting." "Connectivity Changes in Parkinsons Disease."
