This chapter is intended as a primer to the most widely used neuroimaging methods available in the prediction diagnosis and monitoring of the neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the imaging methods that allow us to examine brain structure function and pathology and investigate neurodegenerative mechanisms in vivo. We describe methods to interrogate brain structure with magnetic resonance imaging MRI and brain function with molecular imaging functional MRI and electro- and magneto-encephalography. We highlight the major neuroimaging advances including brain stimulation and connectomics which have brought new insights into a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and describe some of the challenges in imaging clinical populations. Finally we discuss the future of neuroimaging in neurodegenerative disease and its potential for generating predictive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Advances in Neuroimaging for Neurodegenerative Disease.
