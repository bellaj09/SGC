"Structure-based drug discovery methods exploit protein structural information to design small molecules binding to given protein pockets. This work proposes a purely data driven structure-based approach for imaging ligands as spatial fields in target protein pockets. We use an end-to-end deep learning framework trained on experimental protein-ligand complexes with the intention of mimicking a chemists intuition at manually placing atoms when designing a new compound. We show that these models can generate spatial images of ligand chemical properties like occupancy aromaticity and donor-acceptor matching the protein pocket."
