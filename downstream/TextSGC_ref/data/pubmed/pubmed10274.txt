Social deficit is a core symptom in autism spectrum disorder ASD. Although deep brain stimulation DBS has been proposed as a potential treatment for ASD an ideal target nucleus is yet to be identified. DBS at the central thalamic nucleus CTN is known to alter corticostriatal and limbic circuits and subsequently increase the exploratory motor behaviors cognitive performance and skill learning in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. MR imaging central thalamic deep brain stimulation restored autistic-like social deficits in the rat.
