Deep learning DL has been shown to be effective in developing diabetic retinopathy DR algorithms possibly tackling financial and manpower challenges hindering implementation of DR screening. However our systematic review of the literature reveals few studies studied the impact of different factors on these DL algorithms that are important for clinical deployment in real-world settings. Using 455491 retinal images we evaluated two technical and three image-related factors in detection of referable DR. For technical factors the performances of four DL models VGGNet ResNet DenseNet Ensemble and two computational frameworks Caffe TensorFlow were evaluated while for image-related factors we evaluated image compression levels reducing image size 350 300 250 200 150\u2009KB number of fields 7-field 2-field 1-field and media clarity pseudophakic vs phakic. In detection of referable DR four DL models showed comparable diagnostic performance AUC 0.936-0.944. To develop the VGGNet model two computational frameworks had similar AUC 0.936. The DL performance dropped when image size decreased below 250\u2009KB AUC 0.936 0.900 p\u2009<\u20090.001. The DL performance performed better when there were increased number of fields dataset 1: 2-field vs 1-field-AUC 0.936 vs 0.908 p\u2009<\u20090.001; dataset 2: 7-field vs 2-field vs 1-field AUC 0.949 vs 0.911 vs 0.895. DL performed better in the pseudophakic than phakic eyes AUC 0.918 vs 0.833 p\u2009<\u20090.001. Various image-related factors play more significant roles than technical factors in determining the diagnostic performance suggesting the importance of having robust training and testing datasets for DL training and deployment in the real-world settings.
