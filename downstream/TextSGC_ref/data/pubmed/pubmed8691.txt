Training in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP requires the development of technical cognitive and integrative skills well beyond those needed for standard endoscopic procedures. So far there are limited data regarding what constitutes competency in ERCP including achievement and maintenance. Recent studies have highlighted overall procedural numbers are not enough to warrant competency although more is better. We performed a comprehensive literature search until June 2017 using predetermined search terms to identify relevant articles and summarized their results as a narrative review. Selective native papilla deep cannulation should be used as a benchmark for assessing successful cannulation. Accurate and validated ERCP performance measures are needed to develop a curriculum that allows transition from numbers-based competency. However available guidelines fail to state what degree of hands-on involvement is required by the trainee for the case to be counted in their overall procedural numbers. Qualitative assessment of competency should be done by trained raters using specially designed assessment tools. Competence continues to increase with practice following formal training in a fairly steady manner. The learning curve for overall common bile duct cannulation success may be a readily available surrogate for individual trainee progression and may correspond to learning curves for therapeutic interventions. Quality and competence in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography - Where are we 50 years later?
