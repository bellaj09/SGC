We have exploited whole brain microscopy to map the progressive deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in intact cleared mouse brain. We found that the three-dimensional spreading pattern of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain of an aging Tau.P301L mouse model did not resemble that observed in AD patients. Injection of synthetic or patient-derived tau fibrils in the CA1 region resulted in a more faithful spreading pattern. Atlas-guided volumetric analysis showed a connectome-dependent spreading from the injection site and also revealed hyperphosphorylated tau deposits beyond the direct anatomical connections. In fibril-injected brains we also detected a persistent subpopulation of rod-like and swollen microglia. Furthermore we showed that the hyperphosphorylated tau load could be reduced by intracranial co-administration of and to a lesser extent by repeated systemic dosing with an antibody targeting the microtubule-binding domain of tau. Thus the combination of targeted seeding and in toto staging of tau pathology allowed assessing regional vulnerability in a comprehensive manner and holds potential as a preclinical drug validation tool.
