In otorhinolaryngology training introduction to temporal bone surgery through hands-on practice on cadaveric human temporal bones is the gold-standard training method before commencing supervised surgery.

Alternatives to traditional training can consist of drilling artificial models made of plaster or plastic but also virtual reality VR simulation. Nevertheless the integration and availability of these alternatives into specialist training programs remain unknown. European status on temporal bone training: a questionnaire study.
