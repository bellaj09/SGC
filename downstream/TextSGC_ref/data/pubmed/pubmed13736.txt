"Nonpenetrating glaucoma surgeries have been developed in recent years in order to improve the safety of conventional filtering procedures. The goal of nonpenetrating filtering procedures is to reduce intraocular pressure by enhancing the natural aqueous outflow channels while reducing outflow resistance located in the inner wall of the Schlemms canal and the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork. In the last few years viscocanalostomy and deep sclerectomy with external trabeculectomy have become the most popular nonpenetrating filtering procedures. Both involve removal of a deep scleral flap the external wall of Schlemms canal and corneal stroma behind the anterior trabeculum and Descemets membrane thus creating an intrascleral space. The aqueous humour leaves the anterior chamber through the intact trabeculo-Descemets membrane into the scleral space from where it will egress into different pathways. The technique is associated with a long learning curve. Published clinical trials comparing nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery to full-thickness trabeculectomy have a consensus on the superior safety profile of nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery but are not in agreement when it comes to efficacy where conflicting results have been found. This article reviews the nonpenetrating surgical techniques mechanisms of action indications contraindications complications and results." Nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery.
