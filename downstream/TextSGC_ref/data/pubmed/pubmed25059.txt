A new rehabilitation training system designated as a virtual cycling system was developed to improve postural balance control by combining virtual reality VR technology with a bicycle. Several parameters including path deviation path deviation velocity cycling time and head movement were extracted and evaluated to quantify the extent of control. The system was effective as a training device and in addition the technology might have a wider applicability to the rehabilitation field.
