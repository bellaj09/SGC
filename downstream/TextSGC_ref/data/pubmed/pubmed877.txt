The recent SARS-Cov2 pandemic which has recently affected Italy since February 21 constitutes a threat for normal subjects as the Coronavirus Disease 19 COVID19 can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even death. There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-Cov2.
