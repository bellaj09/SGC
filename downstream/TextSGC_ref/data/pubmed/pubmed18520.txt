Illusions of self-motion vection can provide compelling sensations of moving through virtual environments without the need for complex motion simulators or large tracked physical walking spaces. Here we explore the interaction between biomechanical cues stepping along a rotating circular treadmill and visual cues viewing simulated self-rotation for providing stationary users a compelling sensation of rotational self-motion circular vection. When tested individually biomechanical and visual cues were similarly effective in eliciting self-motion illusions. However in combination they yielded significantly more intense self-motion illusions. These findings provide the first compelling evidence that walking motions can be used to significantly enhance visually induced rotational self-motion perception in virtual environments and vice versa without having to provide for physical self-motion or motion platforms. This is noteworthy as linear treadmills have been found to actually impair visually induced translational self-motion perception Ash Palmisano Apthorp & Allison 2013. Given the predominant focus on linear walking interfaces for virtual-reality locomotion our findings suggest that investigating circular and curvilinear walking interfaces offers a promising direction for future research and development and can help to enhance self-motion illusions presence and immersion in virtual-reality systems. Can walking motions improve visually induced rotational self-motion illusions in virtual reality?
