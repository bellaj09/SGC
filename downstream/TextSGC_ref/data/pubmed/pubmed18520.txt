When interacting with virtual environments feedback delays between making a movement and seeing the visual consequences of that movement are detrimental for the subjective quality of the VR experience. Here we used standard measures of subjective experiences such as ownership agency and presence to investigate whether prolonged exposure to the delay and thus the possibility to adapt to it leads to the recovery of the qualitative experience of VR. Participants performed a target-tracking task in a Virtual Reality environment. We measured the participants\ tracking performance in terms of spatial and temporal errors with respect to the target in both No-Delay and Delay conditions. Additionally participants rated their sense of "ownership" of holding a virtual tool agency and presence on each trial using sliding scales. These single trial ratings were compared to the results of the more traditional questionnaires for ownership and agency and presence for both No-Delay and Delay conditions. We found that the participants\ sliding scales ratings corresponded very well to the scores obtained from the traditional questionnaires. Moreover not only did participants behaviourally adapt to the delay their ratings of ownership and agency significantly improved with prolonged exposure to the delay. Together the results suggest a tight link between the ability to perform a behavioural task and the subjective ratings of ownership and agency in virtual reality. Effects of prolonged exposure to feedback delay on the qualitative subjective experience of virtual reality.
