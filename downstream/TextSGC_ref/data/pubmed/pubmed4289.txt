Connectomics-the study of how neurons wire together in the brain-is at the forefront of modern neuroscience research. However many connectomics studies are limited by the time and precision needed to correctly segment large volumes of electron microscopy EM image data. We present here a semi-automated segmentation pipeline using freely available software that can significantly decrease segmentation time for extracting both nuclei and cell bodies from EM image volumes. Rapid and Semi-automated Extraction of Neuronal Cell Bodies and Nuclei from Electron Microscopy Image Stacks.
