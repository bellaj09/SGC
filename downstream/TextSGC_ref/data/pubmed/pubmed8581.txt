"We experimentally demonstrate the use of deep neural networks DNNs in combination with signals amplitude histograms AHs for simultaneous optical signal-to-noise ratio OSNR monitoring and modulation format identification MFI in digital coherent receivers. The proposed technique automatically extracts OSNR and modulation format dependent features of AHs obtained after constant modulus algorithm CMA equalization and exploits them for the joint estimation of these parameters. Experimental results for 112 Gbps polarization-multiplexed PM quadrature phase-shift keying QPSK 112 Gbps PM 16 quadrature amplitude modulation 16-QAM and 240 Gbps PM 64-QAM signals demonstrate OSNR monitoring with mean estimation errors of 1.2 dB 0.4 dB and 1 dB respectively. Similarly the results for MFI show 100% identification accuracy for all three modulation formats. The proposed technique applies deep machine learning algorithms inside standard digital coherent receiver and does not require any additional hardware. Therefore it is attractive for cost-effective multi-parameter estimation in next-generation elastic optical networks EONs."
