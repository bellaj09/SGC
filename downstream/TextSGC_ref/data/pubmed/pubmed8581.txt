"Beam orientation selection whether manual or protocol-based is the current clinical standard in radiation therapy treatment planning but it is tedious and can yield suboptimal results. Many algorithms have been designed to optimize beam orientation selection because of its impact on treatment plan quality but these algorithms suffer from slow calculation of the dose influence matrices of all candidate beams. We propose a fast beam orientation selection method based on deep learning neural networks DNN capable of developing a plan comparable to those developed by the state-of-the-art column generation CG method. Our models novelty lies in its supervised learning structure using CG to teach the network DNN architecture and ability to learn from anatomical features to predict dosimetrically suitable beam orientations without using dosimetric information from the candidate beams. This may save hours of computation." A fast deep learning approach for beam orientation optimization for prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.
