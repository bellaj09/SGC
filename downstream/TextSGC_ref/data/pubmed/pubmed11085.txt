"The disorder distribution of protein in the compartment or organelle leads to many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease. The prediction of protein subcellular localization play important roles in the understanding of the mechanism of protein function pathogenes and disease therapy. This paper proposes a novel subcellular localization method by integrating the Convolutional Neural Network CNN and eXtreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost where CNN acts as a feature extractor to automatically obtain features from the original sequence information and a XGBoost classifier as a recognizer to identify the protein subcellular localization based on the output of the CNN. Experiments are implemented on three protein datasets. The results prove that the CNN-XGBoost method performs better than the general protein subcellular localization methods."
