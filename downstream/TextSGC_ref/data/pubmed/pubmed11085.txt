Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ADPKD is the most common inherited disorder of the kidneys. It is characterized by enlargement of the kidneys caused by progressive development of renal cysts and thus assessment of total kidney volume TKV is crucial for studying disease progression in ADPKD. However automatic segmentation of polycystic kidneys is a challenging task due to severe alteration in the morphology caused by non-uniform cyst formation and presence of adjacent liver cysts. In this study an automated segmentation method based on deep learning has been proposed for TKV computation on computed tomography CT dataset of ADPKD patients exhibiting mild to moderate or severe renal insufficiency. The proposed method has been trained n\u2009=\u2009165 and tested n\u2009=\u200979 on a wide range of TKV 321.2-14670.7\u2009mL achieving an overall mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.86\u2009\u20090.07 mean\u2009\u2009SD between automated and manual segmentations from clinical experts and a mean correlation coefficient  of 0.98 p\u2009<\u20090.001 for segmented kidney volume measurements in the entire test set. Our method facilitates fast and reproducible measurements of kidney volumes in agreement with manual segmentations from clinical experts.
