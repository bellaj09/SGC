While several research methods were developed to estimate individual-based representations of brain connectional wiring i.e. a connectome traditionally captured using multimodal MRI data e.g. functional and diffusion MRI very limited works aimed to estimate brain network atlas for a population of connectomes. Estimating well-representative brain templates is a key step for group comparison studies. However estimating a network atlas for a population of multi-source brain connectomes lying on different manifolds is absent. Clustering-based multi-view network fusion for estimating brain network atlases of healthy and disordered populations.
