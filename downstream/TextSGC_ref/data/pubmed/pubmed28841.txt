"Previous studies of intracortical brain-computer interfaces BCIs have often focused on or compared the use of spiking activity and local field potentials LFPs for decoding kinematic movement parameters. Conversely using these signals to detect the initial intention to use a neuroprosthetic device or not has remained a relatively understudied problem. In this study we examined the relative performance of spiking activity and LFP signals in detecting discrete state changes in attention regarding a users desire to actively control a BCI device. Preliminary offline results suggest that the beta and high gamma frequency bands of LFP activity demonstrated a capacity for discriminating idle/active BCI control states equal to or greater than firing rate activity on the same channel. Population classifier models using either signal modality demonstrated an indistinguishably high degree of accuracy in decoding rest periods from active BCI reach periods as well as other portions of active BCI task trials. These results suggest that either signal modality may be used to reliably detect discrete state changes on a fine time scale for the purpose of gating neural prosthetic movements."
