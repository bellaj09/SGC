Several methods are proposed to manipulate and pattern liquid metal films into elastic conductors but all lack precise control over the film thickness and roughness thereby limiting its uniformity stability and reproducibility. Here an approach relying solely on wetting phenomena is proposed to produce smooth film of liquid gallium Ga on extended surface areas with controlled thickness and electrical properties. The surface chemistry and topography of silicone rubber polydimethylsiloxane is engineered with microstructured pillars and gold precoating layer to produce Ga superlyophilic substrates. Physical vapor deposition of Ga on such substrates leads to the formation of smooth and homogeneous films by imbibition of the surface topography rather than coalescence and formation of Ga drops. By capillarity Ga accumulates in between the pillars up to their top surface forming a smooth film with a root mean square roughness Rq smaller than 100 nm. The wetting conditions and electromechanical properties of the resulting films are compared based on the selection of the microtexture patterns and a model of the film sheet resistance as a function of the texture geometrical parameters is established.
