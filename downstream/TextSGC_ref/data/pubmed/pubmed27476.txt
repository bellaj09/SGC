Despite decades of research on EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS there is still little known about how the disease affects the electromagnetic field of the brain. This may be one reason for the present failure of EEG-based BCI paradigms for completely locked-in ALS patients. In order to help understand this failure we have recorded resting state data from six ALS patients and thirty-two healthy controls to investigate for group differences. While similar studies have been attempted in the past none have used high-density EEG or tried to distinguish between physiological and non-physiological sources of the EEG. We find an ALS-specific global increase in gamma power 30-90 Hz that is not specific to the motor cortex suggesting that the mechanism behind ALS affects non-motor cortical regions even in the absence of comorbid cognitive deficits.
