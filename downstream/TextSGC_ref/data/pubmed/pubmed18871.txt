Objects learned within single enclosed spaces e.g. rooms can be represented within a single reference frame. Contrarily the representation of navigable spaces multiple interconnected enclosed spaces is less well understood. In this study we examined different levels of integration within memory local regional global when learning object locations in navigable space. Participants consecutively learned two distinctive regions of a virtual environment that eventually converged at a common transition point and subsequently solved a pointing task. In Experiment 1 pointing latency increased with increasing corridor distance to the target and additionally when pointing into the other region. Further when pointing within a region alignment with local and regional reference frames when pointing across regional boundaries alignment with a global reference frame was found to accelerate pointing. Thus participants memorized local corridors clustered corridors into regions and integrated globally across the entire environment. Introducing the transition point at the beginning of learning each region in Experiment 2 caused previous region effects to vanish. Our findings emphasize the importance of locally confined spaces for structuring spatial memory and suggest that the opportunity to integrate novel into existing spatial information early during learning may influence unit formation on the regional level. Further global representations seem to be consulted only when accessing spatial information beyond regional borders. Our results are inconsistent with conceptions of spatial memory for large scale environments based either exclusively on local reference frames or upon a single reference frame encompassing the whole environment but rather support hierarchical representation of space.
