The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of immersion in a virtual reality environment on knee biomechanics in patients after ACL reconstruction ACLR. It was hypothesized that virtual reality techniques aimed to change attentional focus would influence altered knee flexion angle knee extension moment and peak vertical ground reaction force vGRF in patients following ACLR. Immersive virtual reality improves movement patterns in patients after ACL reconstruction: implications for enhanced criteria-based return-to-sport rehabilitation.
