Flame chemiluminescence tomography FCT plays an important role in combustion monitoring and diagnostics due to the easy implementation and non-intrusion. However on account of the high data throughput and the inefficiency of the conventional iteration methods the 3D reconstructions in FCT are typically conducted off-line and time-consuming. In this work we present a 3D rapid FCT reconstruction system based on convolutional neural networks CNN model for practical combustion measurement which has the ability to reconstruct 3D flame distribution rapidly after training process. First the numerical simulation has been performed by creating three cases of phantoms which are designed to mimic the 3D conical flame. Next after the evaluation of loss function and training time the optimal CNN architecture has been determined and certificated quantitatively. Finally a real time FCT system consisting of 12 color CCD cameras is realized and multispectral separation algorithm is adopted to extract CH* and C2* components. Certificated by practical measurements testing the proposed CNN model is able to reconstruct 3D flame structure from real time captured projections with credible accuracy and structure similarity. Furthermore compared with conventional iteration reconstruction method the proposed CNN model shows better performance on obviously improving reconstruction speed and it is expected to achieve 3D rapid monitoring of flames.
