"For many decades ultrasonic imaging inspection has been adopted as a principal method to detect multiple defects e.g. void and corrosion. However the data interpretation relies on an inspectors subjective judgment thus making the results vulnerable to human error. Nowadays advanced computer vision techniques reveal new perspectives on the high-level visual understanding of universal tasks. This research aims to develop an efficient automatic ultrasonic image analysis system for nondestructive testing NDT using the latest visual information processing technique. To this end we first established an ultrasonic inspection image dataset containing 6849 ultrasonic scan images with full defect/no-defect annotations. Using the dataset we performed a comprehensive experimental comparison of various computer vision techniques including both conventional methods using hand-crafted visual features and the most recent convolutional neural networks CNN which generate multiple-layer stacking for representation learning. In the computer vision community the two groups are referred to as shallow and deep learning respectively. Experimental results make it clear that the deep learning-enabled system outperformed conventional shallow learning schemes by a large margin. We believe this benchmarking could be used as a reference for similar research dealing with automatic defect detection in ultrasonic imaging inspection."
