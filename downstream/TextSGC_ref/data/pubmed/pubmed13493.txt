Assessments of landslide disasters are becoming increasingly urgent. The aim of this study is to investigate a convolutional neural network CNN framework for landslide susceptibility mapping LSM in Yanshan County China. The two primary contributions of this study are summarized as follows. First to the best of our knowledge this report describes the first time that the CNN framework is used for LSM. Second different data representation algorithms are developed to construct three novel CNN architectures. In this work sixteen influencing factors associated with landslide occurrence were considered and historical landslide locations were randomly divided into training 70% of the total and validation 30% sets. Validation of these CNNs was performed using different commonly used measures in comparison to several of the most popular machine learning and deep learning methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the proportions of highly susceptible zones in all of the CNN landslide susceptibility maps are highly similar and lower than 30% which indicates that these CNNs are more practical for landslide prevention and management than conventional methods. Furthermore the proposed CNN framework achieved higher or comparable prediction accuracy. Specifically the proposed CNNs were 3.94%-7.45% and 0.079-0.151 higher than those of the optimized support vector machine SVM in terms of overall accuracy OA and Matthews correlation coefficient MCC respectively.
