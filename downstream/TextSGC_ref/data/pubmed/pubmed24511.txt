The technological ability to capture electrophysiological activity of populations of cortical neurons through chronic implantable devices has led to significant advancements in the field of brain-computer interfaces. Recent progress in the field has been driven by developments in integrated microelectronics wireless communications materials science and computational neuroscience. Here we review major device development landmarks in the arena of neural interfaces from FDA-approved clinical systems to prototype head-mounted and fully implantable wireless systems for multi-channel neural recording. Additionally we provide an outlook toward next-generation highly miniaturized technologies for minimally invasive vastly parallel neural interfaces for naturalistic closed-loop neuroprostheses.
