Virtual reality VR technology is complex and relies on multidisciplinary knowledge. VR applications are attracting an increasing interest among neuroscientists in particular in the study of the human brain. Here we present a brief tutorial in which we address aspects of VR methodology that are most relevant to neurophysiology applications. After a brief survey of possible applications to neurophysiology we discuss the following issues in VR: display technology visual stimulus presentation techniques visual spatial resolution and accuracy devices for real-time interaction with the virtual environment and force-feedback. Virtual reality: a tutorial.
