It is becoming increasingly clear that psychosis occurs along a continuum. At the high end are formal psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and at the low-end are individuals who experience occasional psychotic symptoms but are otherwise healthy non-clinical psychosis NCP. Schizophrenia has been shown to be marked by altered patterns of connectivity between brain regions but it is not known if such dysconnectivity exists in NCP. In the current study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI to compare resting-state functional connectivity in NCP individuals n\xa0=\xa025 and healthy controls n\xa0=\xa027 for four brain networks of interest fronto-parietal cingulo-opercular default mode and cerebellar networks. NCP individuals showed reduced connectivity compared to controls between regions of the default mode network and frontal regions and between regions in all of the networks and the thalamus. NCP individuals showed greater connectivity compared to controls within regions of frontal control networks. Further positive symptom scores in NCP individuals were positively correlated with connectivity between the cingulo-opercular network and the visual cortex and were negatively correlated with connectivity between the cerebellar network and the posterior parietal cortex and dorsal premotor cortex. Connectivity was not correlated with positive symptom scores in controls. Taken together these findings demonstrate that a spectrum of abnormal connectivity underlies the psychosis continuum and that individuals with sub-clinical psychotic experiences represent a key population for understanding pathogenic processes. Widespread brain dysconnectivity associated with psychotic-like experiences in the general population.
