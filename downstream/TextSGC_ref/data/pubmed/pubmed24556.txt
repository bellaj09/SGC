"This paper presents a project on the development of a cursor control emulating the typical operations of a computer-mouse using gyroscope and eye-blinking electromyographic signals which are obtained through a commercial 16-electrode wireless headset recently released by Emotiv. The cursor position is controlled using information from a gyroscope included in the headset. The clicks are generated through the users blinking with an adequate detection procedure based on the spectral-like technique called Empirical Mode Decomposition EMD. EMD is proposed as a simple and quick computational tool yet effective aimed to artifact reduction from head movements as well as a method to detect blinking signals for mouse control. Kalman filter is used as state estimator for mouse position control and jitter removal. The detection rate obtained in average was 94.9%. Experimental setup and some obtained results are presented."
