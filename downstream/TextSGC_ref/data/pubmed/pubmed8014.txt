"Health monitoring and its related technologies is an attractive research area. The electrocardiogram ECG has always been a popular measurement scheme to assess and diagnose cardiovascular diseases CVDs. The number of ECG monitoring systems in the literature is expanding exponentially. Hence it is very hard for researchers and healthcare experts to choose compare and evaluate systems that serve their needs and fulfill the monitoring requirements. This accentuates the need for a verified reference guiding the design classification and analysis of ECG monitoring systems serving both researchers and professionals in the field. In this paper we propose a comprehensive expert-verified taxonomy of ECG monitoring systems and conduct an extensive systematic review of the literature. This provides evidence-based support for critically understanding ECG monitoring systems components contexts features and challenges. Hence a generic architectural model for ECG monitoring systems is proposed an extensive analysis of ECG monitoring systems value chain is conducted and a thorough review of the relevant literature classified against the experts taxonomy is presented highlighting challenges and current trends. Finally we identify key challenges and emphasize the importance of smart monitoring systems that leverage new technologies including deep learning artificial intelligence AI Big Data and Internet of Things IoT to provide efficient cost-aware and fully connected monitoring systems."
