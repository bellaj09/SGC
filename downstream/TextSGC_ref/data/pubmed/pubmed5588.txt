Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli STEC serogroups such as O26 O45 O103 O111 O121 and O145 often cause illness to people in the United States and the conventional identification of these "Big-Six" are complex. The label-free hyperspectral microscope imaging HMI method which provides spectral "fingerprints" information of bacterial cells was employed to classify serogroups at the cellular level. In spectral analysis principal component analysis PCA method and stacked auto-encoder SAE method were conducted to extract principal spectral features for classification task. Based on these features multiple classifiers including linear discriminant analysis LDA support vector machine SVM and soft-max regression SR methods were evaluated. Different sizes of datasets were also tested in search for the suitable classification models. Among the results SAE-based classification models performed better than PCA-based models achieving classification accuracy of SAE-LDA 93.5% SAE-SVM 94.9% and SAE-SR 94.6% respectively. In contrast classification results of PCA-based methods such as PCA-LDA PCA-SVM and PCA-SR were only 75.5% 85.7% and 77.1% respectively. The results also suggested the increasing number of training samples have positive effects on classification models. Taking advantage of increasing dataset the SAE-SR classification model finally performed better than others with average accuracy of 94.9% in classifying STEC serogroups. Specifically O103 serogroup was classified with the highest accuracy of 97.4% followed by O111 96.5% O26 95.3% O121 95% O145 92.9% and O45 92.4% respectively. Thus the HMI technology coupled with SAE-SR classification model has the potential for "Big-Six" identification.
