In traditional image denoising noise level is an important scalar parameter which decides how much the input noisy image should be smoothed. Existing noise estimation methods often assume that the noise level is constant at every pixel. However real-world noise is signal dependent or the noise level is not constant over the whole image. In this paper we attempt to estimate the precise and pixelwise noise level instead of a simple global scalar. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work on the problem. Particularly we propose a deep convolutional neural network named "deep residual noise estimator" DRNE for pixelwise noise-level estimation. We carefully design the architecture of the DRNE which consists of a stack of customized residual blocks without any pooling or interpolation operation. The proposed DRNE formulates the process of noise estimation as pixel-to-pixel prediction. The experimental results show that the DRNE can achieve better performance on nonhomogeneous noise estimation than state-of-the-art methods. In addition the DRNE can bring denoising performance gains in removing signal-dependent Gaussian noise when working with recent deep learning denoising methods.
