Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD is one of the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorders. Studies have tried to find the neural correlations of ADHD with electroencephalography EEG. Due to the heterogeneity in the ADHD population a multivariate EEG profile is useful and the detection of a personalized abnormality in EEG is urgently needed. Deep learning algorithms especially convolutional neural network CNN have made tremendous progress recently and are expected to solve the problem. Use of deep learning to detect personalized spatial-frequency abnormalities in EEGs of children with ADHD.
