In recent years brain-computer interfaces BCIs have become mature enough to immensely benefit from the expertise and tools established in the field of human-computer interaction HCI. One of the core objectives in HCI research is the design of systems that provide a pleasurable user experience UX. While the majority of BCI studies exclusively evaluate common efficiency measures such as classification accuracy and speed single research groups have begun to look at further usability aspects such as ease of use workload and learnability. However these evaluation metrics only cover pragmatic aspects of UX while still not considering the hedonic quality of UX. In order to gain a holistic perspective on UX hedonic quality aspects such as motivation and frustration were also taken into account for our evaluation of three BCI-driven interfaces which were proposed to be used as a two-stage neuroprosthetic control within the EU project MUNDUS. Towards a holistic assessment of the user experience with hybrid BCIs.
