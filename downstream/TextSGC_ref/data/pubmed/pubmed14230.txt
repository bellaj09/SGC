Deep learning DL used for discriminative tasks in ophthalmology such as diagnosing diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration AMD requires large image data sets graded by human experts to train deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs. In contrast generative DL techniques could synthesize large new data sets of artificial retina images with different stages of AMD. Such images could enhance existing data sets of common and rare ophthalmic diseases without concern for personally identifying information to assist medical education of students residents and retinal specialists as well as for training new DL diagnostic models for which extensive data sets from large clinical trials of expertly graded images may not exist.
