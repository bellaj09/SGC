Ultrasound assessment of the lumbar spine improves the success of spinal and epidural anesthesia especially for patients with underlying difficult anatomy. To assist with the teaching and learning of ultrasound-guided neuraxial anesthesia we have created an online interactive educational model http://www.usra.ca/vspine.php and http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/vspine. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the virtual spine model improved the knowledge of neuraxial anatomy and sonoanatomy.
