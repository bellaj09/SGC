Acute severe ulcerative colitis ASUC is a life-threatening condition managed with intravenous steroids followed by infliximab cyclosporine or colectomy for patients with steroid resistance. There are no biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond to therapy; ineffective medical treatment can delay colectomy and increase morbidity and mortality. We aimed to identify biomarkers of response to medical therapy for patients with ASUC. Colonic MicroRNA Profiles Identified by a Deep Learning Algorithm That Predict Responses to Therapy of Patients With Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis.
