We present an efficient deep learning framework for identifying segmenting and classifying cell membranes and nuclei from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 HER2-stained breast cancer images with minimal user intervention. This is a long-standing issue for pathologists because the manual quantification of HER2 is error-prone costly and time-consuming. Hence we propose a deep learning-based HER2 deep neural network Her2Net to solve this issue. The convolutional and deconvolutional parts of the proposed Her2Net framework consisted mainly of multiple convolution layers max-pooling layers spatial pyramid pooling layers deconvolution layers up-sampling layers and trapezoidal long short-term memory TLSTM. A fully connected layer and a softmax layer were also used for classification and error estimation. Finally HER2 scores were calculated based on the classification results. The main contribution of our proposed Her2Net framework includes the implementation of TLSTM and a deep learning framework for cell membrane and nucleus detection segmentation and classification and HER2 scoring. Our proposed Her2Net achieved 96.64% precision 96.79% recall 96.71% F-score 93.08% negative predictive value 98.33% accuracy and a 6.84% false-positive rate. Our results demonstrate the high accuracy and wide applicability of the proposed Her2Net in the context of HER2 scoring for breast cancer evaluation.
