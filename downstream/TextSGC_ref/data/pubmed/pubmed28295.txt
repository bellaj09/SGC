This paper presents an architectural design for adaptive-systems agents FRIEND that use brain state information to make more effective decisions on behalf of a user; measuring brain context versus situational demands. These systems could be useful for alerting users to cognitive workload levels or fatigue and could attempt to compensate for higher cognitive activity by filtering noise information. In some cases such systems could also share control of devices such as pulling over in an automated vehicle. These aim to assist people in everyday systems to perform tasks better and be more aware of internal states. Achieving a functioning system of this sort is a challenge involving a unification of brain- computer-interfaces human-computer-interaction soft-computin deliberative multi-agent systems disciplines. Until recently these were not able to be combined into a usable platform due largely to technological limitations e.g. size cost and processing speed insufficient research on extracting behavioral states from EEG signals and lack of low-cost wireless sensing headsets. We aim to surpass these limitations and develop control architectures for making sense of brain state in applications by realizing an agent architecture for adaptive human-aware technology. In this paper we present an early high-level design towards implementing a multi-purpose brain-monitoring agent system to improve user quality of life through the assistive applications of psycho-physiological monitoring noise-filtering and shared system control.
