Locomotion and posture are influenced and controlled by vestibular visual and somatosensory information. Optic flow and scene polarity are two characteristics of a visual scene that have been identified as being critical in how they affect perceived body orientation and self motion. The goal of this study was to determine the role of optic flow and visual scene polarity on adaptive modification in locomotor trajectory. An object is said to have visual polarity or to be "visually polarized" when it contains an identifiable principal axis with one end distinct from the other. Two computer-generated virtual reality scenes were shown to subjects during 20 min of treadmill walking. One scene was a highly polarized scene while the other was composed of objects displayed in a non-polarized fashion. Both virtual scenes depicted constant rate self motion equivalent to walking counterclockwise around the perimeter of a room. Subjects performed Stepping Tests blindfolded before and after scene exposure to assess adaptive changes in locomotor trajectory. Subjects showed a significant difference in heading direction between pre- and post-adaptation Stepping Tests when exposed to either scene during treadmill walking. However there was no significant difference in the subjects\ heading direction between the two visual scene polarity conditions. Therefore it was inferred from these data that optic flow has a greater role than visual polarity in influencing adaptive locomotor function. Optic flow dominates visual scene polarity in causing adaptive modification of locomotor trajectory.
