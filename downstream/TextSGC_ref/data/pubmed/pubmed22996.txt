"The improvement of the resolution of brain signal and the ability to control external device has been the most important goal in BMI research field. This paper describes a non-invasive brain-actuated manipulator experiment which defined a paradigm for the motion control of a serial manipulator based on motor imagery and shared control. The techniques of component selection spatial filtering and classification of motor imagery were involved. Small-world neural network SWNN was used to classify five brain states. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier we replace the SWNN classifier by a radial basis function RBF networks neural network a standard multi-layered feed-forward backpropagation network SMN and a multi-SVM classifier with the same features for the classification. The results also indicate that the proposed classifier achieves a 3.83% improvement over the best results of other classifiers. We proposed a shared control method consisting of two control patterns to expand the control of BMI from the software angle. The job of path building for reaching the end point was designated as an assessment task. We recorded all paths contributed by subjects and picked up relevant parameters as evaluation coefficients. With the assistance of two control patterns and series of machine learning algorithms the proposed BMI originally achieved the motion control of a manipulator in the whole workspace. According to experimental results we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed BMI method for 3D motion control of a manipulator using EEG during motor imagery."
