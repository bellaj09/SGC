A fundamental challenge in preprocessing pipelines for neuroimaging datasets is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for subsequent analyses. In the same line we suggest here that the application of the consensus clustering approach to brain connectivity matrices can be a valid additional step for connectome processing to find subgroups of subjects with reduced intragroup variability and therefore increasing the separability of the distinct subgroups when connectomes are used as a biomarker. Moreover by partitioning the data with consensus clustering before any group comparison for instance between a healthy population vs. a pathological one we demonstrate that unique regions within each cluster arise and bring new information that could be relevant from a clinical point of view. Connectome sorting by consensus clustering increases separability in group neuroimaging studies.
