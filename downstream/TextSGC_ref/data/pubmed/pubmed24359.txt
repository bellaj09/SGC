"Characterizations of up to date information of the Earths surface are an important application providing insights to urban planning resources monitoring and environmental studies. A large number of change detection CD methods have been developed to solve them by utilizing remote sensing RS images. The advent of high resolution HR remote sensing images further provides challenges to traditional CD methods and opportunities to object-based CD methods. While several kinds of geospatial objects are recognized this manuscript mainly focuses on buildings. Specifically we propose a novel automatic approach combining pixel-based strategies with object-based ones for detecting building changes with HR remote sensing images. A multiresolution contextual morphological transformation called extended morphological attribute profiles EMAPs allows the extraction of geometrical features related to the structures within the scene at different scales. Pixel-based post-classification is executed on EMAPs using hierarchical fuzzy clustering. Subsequently the hierarchical fuzzy frequency vector histograms are formed based on the image-objects acquired by simple linear iterative clustering SLIC segmentation. Then saliency and morphological building index MBI extracted on difference images are used to generate a pseudo training set. Ultimately object-based semi-supervised classification is implemented on this training set by applying random forest RF. Most of the important changes are detected by the proposed method in our experiments. This study was checked for effectiveness using visual evaluation and numerical evaluation."
