Hip resurfacing has been proposed as an alternative to traditional total hip arthroplasty in young active patients. Much has been learned following the introduction of metal-on-metal resurfacing devices in the 1990s. The triad of a well-designed device implanted accurately in the correct patient has never been more critical than with these implants. Following Food and Drug Administration approval in 2006 we studied the safety and effectiveness of one hip resurfacing device Birmingham Hip Resurfacing at our hospital in a large single-surgeon series. We report our early to mid-term results in 1333 cases followed for a mean of 4.3 years 2 to 5.7 using a prospective observational registry. The mean patient age was 53.1 years 12 to 84; 70% were male and 91% had osteoarthritis. Complications were few including no dislocations no femoral component loosening two femoral neck fractures 0.15% one socket loosening 0.08% three deep infections 0.23% and three cases of metallosis 0.23%. There were no destructive pseudotumours. Overall survivorship at up to 5.7 years was 99.2%. Aseptic survivorship in males under the age of 50 was 100%. We believe this is the largest United States series of a single surgeon using a single resurfacing system. Hip resurfacing: a large US single-surgeon series.
