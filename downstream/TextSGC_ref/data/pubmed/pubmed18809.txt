"Evidence based virtual environments VEs that incorporate compensatory strategies such as cueing may change motor behavior and increase exercise intensity while also being engaging and motivating. The purpose of this study was to determine if persons with Parkinsons disease and aged matched healthy adults responded to auditory and visual cueing embedded in a bicycling VE as a method to increase exercise intensity." "Auditory and visual cueing modulate cycling speed of older adults and persons with Parkinsons disease in a Virtual Cycling V-Cycle system."
