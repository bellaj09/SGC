In recent years consumers have witnessed a technological revolution that has delivered more-realistic experiences in their own homes through high-definition stereoscopic televisions and natural gesture-based video game consoles. Although these experiences are more realistic offering higher levels of fidelity it is not clear how the increased display and interaction aspects of fidelity impact the user experience. Since immersive virtual reality VR allows us to achieve very high levels of fidelity we designed and conducted a study that used a six-sided CAVE to evaluate display fidelity and interaction fidelity independently at extremely high and low levels for a VR first-person shooter FPS game. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the effects of fidelity on the user in a complex performance-intensive context. The results of our study indicate that both display and interaction fidelity significantly affect strategy and performance as well as subjective judgments of presence engagement and usability. In particular performance results were strongly in favor of two conditions: low-display low-interaction fidelity representative of traditional FPS games and high-display high-interaction fidelity similar to the real world.
