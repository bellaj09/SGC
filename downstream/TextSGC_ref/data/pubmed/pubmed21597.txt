Early research on brain-computer interfaces BCIs was fueled by the study of event-related potentials ERPs by Farwell and Donchin who are rightly credited for laying important groundwork for the BCI field. However many other researchers have made substantial contributions that have escaped the radar screen of the current BCI community. For example in the late 1980s I worked with a brilliant multidisciplinary research group in electrical engineering at the University of Florida Gainesville headed by Dr. Donald Childers. Childers should be well known to long-time members of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society since he was the editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering in the 1970s and the recipient of one of the most prestigious society awards the William J. Morlock Award in 1973. The cortical mouse: a piece of forgotten history in noninvasive brain&#8211;computer interfaces.
