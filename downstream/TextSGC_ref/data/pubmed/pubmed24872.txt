"Recent years have seen notable advances in virtual reality technology and increased interest in potential medical applications. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data sets historically viewed as axial images may now be used to construct a virtual reality endoscopic image and navigator software systems allow the operator to fly through the urinary tract. Technological evolution has improved the quality of reconstruction as this is dependent on the software and data set allowing virtual reality to begin to challenge endoscopic evaluation. This review describes the evolution of virtual reality in urology and the milestones of its current clinical use. Applications may become widespread in the diagnostic evaluation of common urological symptoms the planning of surgery and the training of future urologists." Virtual endoscopy in urology.
