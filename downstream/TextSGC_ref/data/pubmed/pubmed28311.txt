We outline general theoretical and practical implications of what we promote as enactive cinema for the neuroscientific study of online socio-emotional interaction. In a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging rt-fMRI setting participants are immersed in cinematic experiences that simulate social situations. While viewing their physiological reactions-including brain responses-are tracked representing implicit and unconscious experiences of the on-going social situations. These reactions in turn are analyzed in real-time and fed back to modify the cinematic sequences they are viewing while being scanned. Due to the engaging cinematic content the proposed setting focuses on living-by in terms of shared psycho-physiological epiphenomena of experience rather than active coping in terms of goal-oriented motor actions. It constitutes a means to parametrically modify stimuli that depict social situations and their broader environmental contexts. As an alternative to studying the variation of brain responses as a function of a priori fixed stimuli this method can be applied to survey the range of stimuli that evoke similar responses across participants at particular brain regions of interest. Enactive cinema paves way for understanding complex real-time social interaction in neuroimaging experiments.
