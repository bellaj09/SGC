Considerable number of indoor navigation systems has been proposed to augment people with visual impairments VI about their surroundings. These systems leverage several technologies such as computer-vision Bluetooth low energy BLE and other techniques to estimate the position of a user in indoor areas. Computer-vision based systems use several techniques including matching pictures classifying captured images recognizing visual objects or visual markers. BLE based system utilizes BLE beacons attached in the indoor areas as the source of the radio frequency signal to localize the position of the user. Comparative analysis of computer-vision and BLE technology based indoor navigation systems for people with visual impairments.
