Existing summary statistics based upon optical coherence tomographic OCT scans and/or visual fields VFs are suboptimal for distinguishing between healthy and glaucomatous eyes in the clinic. This study evaluates the extent to which a hybrid deep learning method HDLM combined with a single wide-field OCT protocol can distinguish eyes previously classified as either healthy suspects or mild glaucoma. Hybrid Deep Learning on Single Wide-field Optical Coherence tomography Scans Accurately Classifies Glaucoma Suspects.
