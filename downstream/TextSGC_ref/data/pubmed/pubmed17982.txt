Anxiety disorders are among the most frequently encountered psychiatric disorders. Recommended treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy CBT and/or medication. In recent years beneficial effects of virtual reality VR exposure therapy have been shown making this technique a promising addition to CBT. However the ability of VR to mimic threatening stimuli in a way comparable to in vivo cues has been discussed. In particular it has been questioned whether VR is capable of provoking psychophysiological symptoms of anxiety. Since psychophysiological arousal is considered a prerequisite for effective exposure treatment this systematic review aims to evaluate the evidence for the potential of VR exposure to evoke and modulate psychophysiological fear reactions. Virtual reality exposure in anxiety disorders: impact on psychophysiological reactivity.
