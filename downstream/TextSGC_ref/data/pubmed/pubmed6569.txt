Quality of single optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA images of myopic choroidal neovascularisation mCNV is poorer than in averaged images although obtaining averaged images takes much time. This study evaluated the clinical usefulness of novel denoising process for depicting mCNV. This study included 20 eyes of 20 patients with mCNV. Ten en face images taken in a 3\u2009\u20093\u2009mm macular cube were obtained from outer-retina-to-choriocapillaris layer. Three image types were prepared for analysis; single images before and after the denoising process accomplished deep learning single and denoising groups respectively and up to 10 images were averaged averaging group. Pairwise comparisons showed vessel density vessel length density and fractal dimension FD were higher; whereas vessel density index VDI was lower in single group than in denoising and averaging groups. Detectable CNV indices contrast-to-nose ratio and CNV diagnostic scores were higher in denoising and averaging groups than in single group. No significant differences were detected in VDI FD or CNV diagnostic scores between denoising and averaging groups. The denoising process can utilise single OCTA images to provide results comparable to averaged OCTA images which is clinically useful for shortening examination times with quality similar to averaging.
