High-throughput protein crystallography using a synchrotron light source is an important method used in drug discovery. Beamline components for automated experiments including automatic sample changers have been utilized to accelerate the measurement of a number of macromolecular crystals. However unlike cryo-loop centering crystal centering involving automated crystal detection is a difficult process to automate fully. Here DeepCentering a new automated crystal centering system is presented. DeepCentering works using a convolutional neural network which is a deep learning operation. This system achieves fully automated accurate crystal centering without using X-ray irradiation of crystals and can be used for fully automated data collection in high-throughput macromolecular crystallography.
