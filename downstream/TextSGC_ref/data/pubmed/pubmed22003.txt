Meal construction is largely governed by nonconscious and habit-based processes that can be represented as a collection of in dividual micro-level food choices that eventually give rise to a final plate. Despite this dietary behavior intervention research rarely captures these micro-level food choice processes instead measuring outcomes at aggregated levels. This is due in part to a dearth of analytic techniques to model these dynamic time-series events. Modeling Dynamic Food Choice Processes to Understand Dietary Intervention Effects.
