Turbulent fluid landscapes impose temporal patterning upon chemical signals and the dynamical neuronal responses to patterned input vary across the olfactory receptor repertoire in flies moths and locusts. Sensory transformations exhibit low pass filtering that ultimately results in perceptual fusion of temporally transient sensory signals. For example humans perceive a sufficiently fast flickering light as continuous but the frequency threshold at which this fusion occurs varies with wavelength. Although the summed frequency sensitivity of the fly antenna has been examined to a considerable extent it is unknown how intermittent odor signals are integrated to influence plume tracking behavior independent of wind cues and whether temporal fusion for behavioral tracking might vary according to the odor encountered. Odor identity influences tracking of temporally patterned plumes in Drosophila.
