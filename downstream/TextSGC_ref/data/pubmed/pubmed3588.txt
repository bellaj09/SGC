"Models of Alzheimers disease AD hypothesize stereotyped progression via white matter WM fiber connections most likely via trans-synaptic transmission of toxic proteins along neuronal pathways. An important question in the field is whether and how organization of fiber pathways is affected by disease. It remains unknown whether fibers act as conduits of degenerative pathologies or if they also degenerate with the gray matter network. This work uses graph theoretic modeling in a longitudinal design to investigate the impact of WM network organization on AD pathology spread. We hypothesize if altered WM network organization mediates disease progression then a previously published network diffusion model will yield higher prediction accuracy using subject-specific connectomes in place of a healthy template connectome. Neuroimaging data in 124 subjects from ADNI were assessed. Graph topology metrics show preserved network organization in patients compared to controls. Using a published diffusion model we further probe the effect of network alterations on degeneration spread in AD. We show that choice of connectome does not significantly impact the models predictive ability. These results suggest that despite measurable changes in integrity of specific fiber tracts WM network organization in AD is preserved. Further there is no difference in the mediation of putative pathology spread between healthy and AD-impaired networks. This conclusion is somewhat at variance with previous results which report global topological disturbances in AD. Our data indicates the combined effect of edge thresholding binarization and inclusion of subcortical regions to network graphs may be responsible for previously reported effects."
