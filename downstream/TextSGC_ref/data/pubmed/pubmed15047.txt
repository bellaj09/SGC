"The aim of this study was to investigate the plantar blood flow response to the same accumulated pressure stimulus in diabetic patients with different peak plantar pressure PPP which is important for assessing the risk of diabetic foot ulcer. Eleven diabetic subjects with high PPP PPP \u2009207\xa0kPa and 8 diabetic subjects with low PPP PPP <\u2009207\xa0kPa were asked to walk naturally on a treadmill so as to induce an accumulated stimulus of 73000\xa0kPas on their first metatarsal head which was monitored with a sensorized insole. Blood perfusion BP in the first metatarsal head was measured before and after walking. Results showed that blood flow after applying the same walking stimulus was significantly decreased in comparison to the basal BP before walking in both high PPP and low PPP groups p\u2009<\u20090.05 but no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of BP parameters and its percentage change p\u2009>\u20090.05. Moreover BP parameters were not significantly correlated to PPP and the pressure-time integral PTI of the subjects gait p\u2009>\u20090.05. This indicated that besides PPP and PTI the accumulated mechanical stimulus should be taken into consideration when assessing the risk of diabetic patients developing foot ulcers.
