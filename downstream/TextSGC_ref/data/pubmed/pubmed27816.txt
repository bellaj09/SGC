Noninvasive Brain Computer Interfaces BCI have been promoted to be used for neuroprosthetics. However reports on applications with electroencephalography EEG show a demand for a better accuracy and stability. Here we investigate whether near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS can be used to enhance the EEG approach. In our study both methods were applied simultaneously in a real-time Sensory Motor Rhythm SMR-based BCI paradigm involving executed movements as well as motor imagery. We tested how the classification of NIRS data can complement ongoing real-time EEG classification. Our results show that simultaneous measurements of NIRS and EEG can significantly improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery in over 90% of considered subjects and increases performance by 5% on average p<0:01. However the long time delay of the hemodynamic response may hinder an overall increase of bit-rates. Furthermore we find that EEG and NIRS complement each other in terms of information content and are thus a viable multimodal imaging technique suitable for BCI. Enhanced performance by a hybrid NIRS-EEG brain computer interface.
