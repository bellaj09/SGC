When considering the teaching and learning of topics of social relevance in medicine such as professionalism medical ethics the doctor-patient relationship and issues of diversity and social justice one is tempted to ask are the ways of knowing in these fields different from that in the biomedical and clinical sciences? Furthermore given that the competency approach is dominant in medical education one might also ask is the competency model truly appropriate for all of the types of knowledge necessary to become a good physician? These questions are not merely academic for they are at the core of how these subjects are taught learned and assessed.The goal of this article is threefold: first to explore the nature of knowing and the educational goals in different areas of medicine and in particular those areas that have social relevance; second to critically review the concept of competencies when applied to education in these areas; and third to explore alternative strategies for teaching learning and assessment. This discussion reflects a view that the goal of education in areas of social relevance in medicine should be the enhancement of an understanding of-a deep and abiding connection with-the social responsibilities of the physician. Moving beyond competencies this approach aspires toward the development of practical wisdom phronesis which when embodied in the physician links the knowledge and skills of the biomedical and clinical sciences with a moral orientation and call to action that addresses human interests in the practice of medicine. From competencies to human interests: ways of knowing and understanding in medical education.
