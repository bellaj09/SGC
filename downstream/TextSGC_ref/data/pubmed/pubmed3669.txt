"The human brain is characterized by highly dynamic patterns of functional connectivity. However it is unknown whether this time-variant connectome is related to\xa0the individual differences in the behavioural and cognitive traits described in the five-factor model\xa0of personality. To answer this question inter-network time-variant connectivity was computed in n\u2009=\u2009818 healthy people via a dynamical conditional correlation model. Next network dynamicity was quantified throughout an ad-hoc measure T-index and the generalizability of the multi-variate associations between personality traits and network dynamicity was assessed using a train/test split approach. Conscientiousness reflecting enhanced cognitive and emotional control was the sole trait linked to stationary connectivity across several circuits such as the default mode and prefronto-parietal network. The stationarity in the communication across large-scale networks offers a mechanistic description of the capacity of conscientious people to protect non-immediate goals against interference over-time. This study informs future research aiming at developing more realistic models of the brain dynamics mediating personality differences."
