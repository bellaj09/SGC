Research of the human brain connectome requires multiscale approaches derived from independent imaging methods ideally applied to the same object. Hence comprehensible strategies for data integration across modalities and across scales are essential. We have successfully established a concept to bridge the spatial scales from microscopic fiber orientation measurements based on 3D-Polarized Light Imaging 3D-PLI to meso- or macroscopic dimensions. By creating orientation distribution functions pliODFs from high-resolution vector data via series expansion with spherical harmonics utilizing high performance computing and supercomputing technologies data fusion with Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging has become feasible even for a large-scale dataset such as the human brain. Validation of our approach was done effectively by means of two types of datasets that were transferred from fiber orientation maps into pliODFs: simulated 3D-PLI data showing artificial but clearly defined fiber patterns and real 3D-PLI data derived from sections through the human brain and the brain of a hooded seal.
