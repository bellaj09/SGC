"Standardized patients SPs individuals who realistically portray patients are widely used in medical education to teach and assess communication skills eliciting a history performing a physical exam and other important clinical skills. They are typically healthy individuals with few or no abnormal physical findings. One limitation is that each SP can only portray a limited set of physical symptoms. We have developed a functioning prototype that uses sound-based augmented reality AR to expand the capabilities of an SP to exhibit physically-manifested abnormalities. The previous research and evaluation of this prototype have been published in medicine meets virtual reality conference in January 2006. Current research has combined a virtual crackle sound with a healthy SPs real breath sound at end of inspiration in real time. The technology used is intended to correlate the inspiration timing of SPs. A learner will hear this simulated sound through an electronic-stethoscope wirelessly."
