Intracortical brain-machine interfaces BMIs transform neural activity into control signals to drive a prosthesis or communication device such as a robotic arm or computer cursor. To be clinically viable BMI decoders must achieve high accuracy and robustness. Optimizing these decoders is expensive traditionally requiring animal or human experiments spanning months to years. This is because BMIs are closed-loop systems where the user updates his or her motor commands in response to an imperfectly decoded output. Decoder optimization using previously collected "offline" data will therefore not capture this closed-loop response. An alternative approach to significantly accelerate decoder optimization is to use a closed-loop experimental simulator. In simulation motor cortical neural population activity is synthetically generated from kinematics and subsequently used for non-invasive closed-loop experiments. A key component of this system is the neural encoder which synthetically generates neural population activity. Prior encoder models based on velocity tuning models fail to capture dynamic features in the neural population activity and reproduce heterogeneity in neuron peri-stimulus time histograms PSTHs. To overcome these limitations we use deep-learning neural encoders to generate synthetic neural population activity. We find these models significantly outperform tuning models in reproducing PSTH variability dynamics in neural populations and neural decoding results in "offline" data. We also find that deep learning encoding models better reproduce closed-loop experimental data. We anticipate these deep-learning encoding models will substantially improve simulators for BMIs enabling faster evaluation optimization and characterization of BMI decoder algorithms.
