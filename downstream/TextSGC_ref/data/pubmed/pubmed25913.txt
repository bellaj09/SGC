In view of recent increase of brain computer interface BCI based applications the importance of efficient classification of various mental tasks has increased prodigiously nowadays. In order to obtain effective classification efficient feature extraction scheme is necessary for which in the proposed method the interchannel relationship among electroencephalogram EEG data is utilized. It is expected that the correlation obtained from different combination of channels will be different for different mental tasks which can be exploited to extract distinctive feature. The empirical mode decomposition EMD technique is employed on a test EEG signal obtained from a channel which provides a number of intrinsic mode functions IMFs and correlation coefficient is extracted from interchannel IMF data. Simultaneously different statistical features are also obtained from each IMF. Finally the feature matrix is formed utilizing interchannel correlation features and intrachannel statistical features of the selected IMFs of EEG signal. Different kernels of the support vector machine SVM classifier are used to carry out the classification task. An EEG dataset containing ten different combinations of five different mental tasks is utilized to demonstrate the classification performance and a very high level of accuracy is achieved by the proposed scheme compared to existing methods.
