To recognize individuals the brain often integrates audiovisual information from familiar or unfamiliar faces voices and auditory names. To date the effects of the semantic familiarity of stimuli on audiovisual integration remain unknown. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study we used familiar/unfamiliar facial images auditory names and audiovisual face-name pairs as stimuli to determine the influence of semantic familiarity on audiovisual integration. First we performed a general linear model analysis using fMRI data and found that audiovisual integration occurred for familiar congruent and unfamiliar face-name pairs but not for familiar incongruent pairs. Second we decoded the familiarity categories of the stimuli familiar vs. unfamiliar from the fMRI data and calculated the reproducibility indices of the brain patterns that corresponded to familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. The decoding accuracy rate was significantly higher for familiar congruent versus unfamiliar face-name pairs 83.2% than for familiar versus unfamiliar faces 63.9% and for familiar versus unfamiliar names 60.4%. This increase in decoding accuracy was not observed for familiar incongruent versus unfamiliar pairs. Furthermore compared with the brain patterns associated with facial images or auditory names the reproducibility index was significantly improved for the brain patterns of familiar congruent face-name pairs but not those of familiar incongruent or unfamiliar pairs. Our results indicate the modulatory effect that semantic familiarity has on audiovisual integration. Specifically neural representations were enhanced for familiar congruent face-name pairs compared with visual-only faces and auditory-only names whereas this enhancement effect was not observed for familiar incongruent or unfamiliar pairs.
