There is theoretical and empirical research supporting the hypothesis that virtual reality technology VRT can be efficaciously applied to attenuate the symptoms of mental disorders Baer 1996; Rothbaum et al 1995a 1995b; Rothbaum et al 1996. Yet there is also research suggesting psychiatric therapeutic applications of VRT may induce noxious or unexpected psychological consequences Kolasinski 1996; Muscott & Gifford 1994; Regan & Price 1994; Regan & Ramsey 1996; Strickland 1995. A prudent conclusion would be to advocate ever more sophisticated studies on psychiatric therapeutic applications of VRT concerning 1 increasing the overall socioadaptiveness of patients 2 the robustness of moderating modifying or other intermediary variables effecting or affecting VRT therapeutic efficacy and 3 variables processes and hypotheses generated from VRT applications in non-psychiatric fields.
