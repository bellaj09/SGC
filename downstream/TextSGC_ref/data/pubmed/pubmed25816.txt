Neural activity prior to movement onset contains essential information for predictive assistance for humans using brain-machine-interfaces BMIs. Even though previous studies successfully predicted different goals for upcoming movements it is unclear whether non-invasive recording signals contain the information to predict trial-by-trial behavioral variability under the same movement. In this paper we examined the predictability of subsequent short or long reaction times RTs from magnetoencephalography MEG signals in a delayed-reach task. The difference in RTs was classified significantly above chance from 550\u2009ms before the go-signal onset using the cortical currents in the premotor cortex. Significantly above-chance classification was performed in the lateral prefrontal and the right inferior parietal cortices at the late stage of the delay period. Thus inter-trial variability in RTs is predictable information. Our study provides a proof-of-concept of the future development of non-invasive BMIs to prevent delayed movements.
