The reconstruction quality of dental computed tomography DCT is vulnerable to metal implants because the presence of dense metallic objects causes beam hardening and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images. These metal artifacts degrade the images and decrease the clinical usefulness of DCT. Although interpolation-based metal artifact reduction MAR methods have been introduced they may not be efficient in DCT because teeth as well as metallic objects have high X-ray attenuation. In this study we investigated an effective MAR method based on a fully convolutional network FCN in both sinogram and image domains. The method consisted of three main steps: 1 segmentation of the metal trace 2 FCN-based restoration in the sinogram domain and 3 FCN-based restoration in image domain followed by metal insertion. We performed a computational simulation and an experiment to investigate the image quality and evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the proposed method were compared with those obtained by the normalized MAR method and the deep learning-based MAR algorithm in the sinogram domain with respect to the root-mean-square error and the structural similarity. Our results indicate that the proposed MAR method significantly reduced the presence of metal artifacts in DCT images and demonstrated better image performance than those of the other algorithms in reducing the streak artifacts without introducing any contrast anomaly.
