In this paper we perform a systematic study about the on-body sensor positioning and data acquisition details for Human Activity Recognition HAR systems. We build a testbed that consists of eight body-worn Inertial Measurement Units IMU sensors and an Android mobile device for activity data collection. We develop a Long Short-Term Memory LSTM network framework to support training of a deep learning model on human activity data which is acquired in both real-world and controlled environments. From the experiment results we identify that activity data with sampling rate as low as 10 Hz from four sensors at both sides of wrists right ankle and waist is sufficient in recognizing Activities of Daily Living ADLs including eating and driving activity. We adopt a two-level ensemble model to combine class-probabilities of multiple sensor modalities and demonstrate that a classifier-level sensor fusion technique can improve the classification performance. By analyzing the accuracy of each sensor on different types of activity we elaborate custom weights for multimodal sensor fusion that reflect the characteristic of individual activities.
