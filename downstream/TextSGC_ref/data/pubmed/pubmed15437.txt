Modern imaging and spectroscopy systems require to implement diverse functionalities with thin thickness and wide wavelength ranges. In order to meet this demand polarization-resolved imaging has been widely investigated with integrated circular polarizers. However the circular polarizers which operate at the entire visible wavelengths and have a thickness of several tens of nanometers have not been developed yet. Here a circular polarizer operating at the entire visible wavelength range is demonstrated using helically stacked aluminum nano-grating layers. High extinction ratio and broad operation bandwidth are simultaneously achieved by using non-resonant anisotropic characteristics of the nano-grating. It is theoretically verified that the averaged extinction ratio becomes up to 8 over the entire visible wavelength range while having a thickness of 390 nm. Also the feasibility of the proposed structure and circular polarization selectivity at the visible wavelength range are experimentally verified. It is expected that the proposed structure will lead to extreme miniaturization of a circular polarizer and contribute greatly to the development of mobile/wearable imaging systems such as virtual reality and augmented reality displays.
