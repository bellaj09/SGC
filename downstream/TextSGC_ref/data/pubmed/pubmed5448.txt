"Resective neurosurgery carries the risk of postoperative cognitive deterioration. The concept of hub overload caused by overuse of the most important brain regions has been theoretically postulated in relation to symptomatology and neurological disease course but lacks experimental confirmation. We investigated functional hub load and postsurgical cognitive deterioration in patients undergoing lesion resection. Patients n\u2009=\u200928 underwent resting-state magnetoencephalography and neuropsychological assessments preoperatively and 1-year after lesion resection. We calculated stationary hub load score SHub indicating to what extent brain regions linked different subsystems; high SHub indicates larger processing pressure on hub regions. Dynamic hub load score DHub assessed its variability over time; low values particularly in combination with high SHub values indicate increased load because of consistently high usage of hub regions. Hypothetically increased SHub and decreased DHub relate to hub overload and thus poorer/deteriorating cognition. Between time points deteriorating verbal memory performance correlated with decreasing upper alpha DHub. Moreover preoperatively low DHub values accurately predicted declining verbal memory performance. In summary dynamic hub load relates to cognitive functioning in patients undergoing lesion resection: postoperative cognitive decline can be tracked and even predicted using dynamic hub load suggesting it may be used as a prognostic marker for tailored treatment planning."
