In nuclear decommissioning virtual simulation technology is a useful tool to achieve an effective work process by using virtual environments to represent the physical and logical scheme of a real decommissioning project. This technology is cost-saving and time-saving with the capacity to develop various decommissioning scenarios and reduce the risk of retrofitting. The method utilises a radiation map in a virtual simulation as the basis for the assessment of exposure to a virtual human. In this paper we propose a fast simulation method using a known radiation source. The method has a unique advantage over point kernel and Monte Carlo methods because it generates the radiation map using interpolation in a virtual environment. The simulation of the radiation map including the calculation and the visualisation were realised using UNITY and MATLAB. The feasibility of the proposed method was tested on a hypothetical case and the results obtained are discussed in this paper.
