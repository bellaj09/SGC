"Understanding the architecture of transcallosal connections would allow for more specific assessments of neurodegeneration across many fields of neuroscience neurology and psychiatry. To map these connections we conducted probabilistic tractography in 100 Human Connectome Project subjects in 32 cortical areas using novel post-processing algorithms to create a spatially precise Trancallosal Tract Template TCATT. We found robust transcallosal tracts in all 32 regions and a topographical analysis in the corpus callosum largely agreed with well-established subdivisions of the corpus callosum. We then obtained diffusion MRI data from a cohort of patients with Alzheimers disease AD and another with progressive supranuclear palsy PSP and used a two-compartment model to calculate free-water corrected fractional anisotropy FAT and free-water FW within the TCATT. These metrics were used to determine between-group differences and to determine which subset of tracts was best associated with cognitive function Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA. In AD we found robust between-group differences in FW 31/32 TCATT tracts in the absence of between-group differences in FAT. FW in the inferior temporal gyrus TCATT tract was most associated with MoCA scores in AD. In PSP there were widespread differences in both FAT and FW and MoCA was predicted by FAT in the inferior frontal pars triangularis preSMA and medial frontal gyrus TCATT tracts as well as FW in the inferior frontal pars opercularis TCATT tract. The TCATT improves spatial localization of corpus callosum measurements to enhance the evaluation of treatment effects as well as the monitoring of brain microstructure in relation to cognitive dysfunction and disease progression. Here we have shown its direct relevance in capturing between-group differences and associating it with the MoCA in AD and PSP."
