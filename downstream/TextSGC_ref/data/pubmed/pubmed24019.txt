Current treatment of intraventricular hemorrhage IVH involves cerebral shunt placement or an invasive brain surgery. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound MRgFUS applied to the brains of pediatric patients presents an opportunity to treat IVH in a noninvasive manner termed "incision-less surgery." Current clinical and research focused ultrasound systems lack the capability to perform neonatal transcranial surgeries due to either range of motion or dexterity requirements. A novel robotic system is proposed to position a focused ultrasound transducer accurately above the head of a neonatal patient inside an MRI machine to deliver the therapy. Design and validation of an MR-conditional robot for transcranial focused ultrasound surgery in infants.
