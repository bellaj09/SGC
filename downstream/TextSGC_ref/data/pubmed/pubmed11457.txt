Accurate prioritization of potential disease genes is a fundamental challenge in biomedical research. Various algorithms have been developed to solve such problems. Inductive Matrix Completion IMC is one of the most reliable models for its well established framework and its superior performance in predicting gene-disease associations. However the IMC method does not hierarchically extract deep features which might limit the quality of recovery. In this case the architecture of deep learning which obtains high-level representations and handles noises and outliers presented in large-scale biological datasets is introduced into the side information of genes in our Deep Collaborative Filtering DCF model. Further for lack of negative examples we also exploit Positive-Unlabeled PU learning formulation to low-rank matrix completion.Our approach achieves substantially improved performance over other state-of-the-art methods on diseases from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man OMIM database. Our approach is 6% more efficient than standard IMC in detecting a true association and significantly outperforms other alternatives in terms of the precision-recall metric at the top-k predictions. Moreover we also validate the disease with no previously known gene associations and newly reported OMIM associations. The experimental results show that DCF is still satisfactory for ranking novel disease phenotypes as well as mining unexplored relationships.
