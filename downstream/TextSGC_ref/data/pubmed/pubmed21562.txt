Individuals with severe motor impairment can use event-related desynchronization ERD based BCIs as assistive technology. Auto-calibrating and adaptive ERD-based BCIs that users control with motor imagery tasks "SMR-AdBCI" have proven effective for healthy users. We aim to find an improved configuration of such an adaptive ERD-based BCI for individuals with severe motor impairment as a result of spinal cord injury SCI or stroke. We hypothesized that an adaptive ERD-based BCI that automatically selects a user specific class-combination from motor-related and non motor-related mental tasks during initial auto-calibration "Auto-AdBCI" could allow for higher control performance than a conventional SMR-AdBCI. To answer this question we performed offline analyses on two sessions 21 data sets total of cue-guided five-class electroencephalography EEG data recorded from individuals with SCI or stroke. On data from the twelve individuals in Session 1 we first identified three bipolar derivations for the SMR-AdBCI. In a similar way we determined three bipolar derivations and four mental tasks for the Auto-AdBCI. We then simulated both the SMR-AdBCI and the Auto-AdBCI configuration on the unseen data from the nine participants in Session 2 and compared the results. On the unseen data of Session 2 from individuals with SCI or stroke we found that automatically selecting a user specific class-combination from motor-related and non motor-related mental tasks during initial auto-calibration Auto-AdBCI significantly p < 0.01 improved classification performance compared to an adaptive ERD-based BCI that only used motor imagery tasks SMR-AdBCI; average accuracy of 75.7 vs. 66.3%. Non-motor tasks improve adaptive brain-computer interface performance in users with severe motor impairment.
