Sleep disorder is a symptom of many neurological diseases that may significantly affect the quality of daily life. Traditional methods are time-consuming and involve the manual scoring of polysomnogram PSG signals obtained in a laboratory environment. However the automated monitoring of sleep stages can help detect neurological disorders accurately as well. In this study a flexible deep learning model is proposed using raw PSG signals. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network 1D-CNN is developed using electroencephalogram EEG and electrooculogram EOG signals for the classification of sleep stages. The performance of the system is evaluated using two public databases sleep-edf and sleep-edfx. The developed model yielded the highest accuracies of 98.06% 94.64% 92.36% 91.22% and 91.00% for two to six sleep classes respectively using the sleep-edf database. Further the proposed model obtained the highest accuracies of 97.62% 94.34% 92.33% 90.98% and 89.54% respectively for the same two to six sleep classes using the sleep-edfx dataset. The developed deep learning model is ready for clinical usage and can be tested with big PSG data. A Deep Learning Model for Automated Sleep Stages Classification Using PSG Signals.
