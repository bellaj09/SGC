"Collaborative learning attracts attention because of its potential as a powerful learning strategy. This also holds for PBL. However group work in PBL sometimes encounters problems and the quality of interaction is not always at the desired level. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess the quality of learning-oriented group interactions in PBL in an uncomplicated way. The questionnaire to be completed by students involved in PBL contained items on three group-interaction dimensions: exploratory questions cumulative reasoning and handling conflicts. It was validated by means of confirmatory factor analysis and regression analysis the latter to investigate the relation between the three-dimension model and the tutorial groups productivity. The factors underlying the questionnaire were confirmed by the data in a linear structural analysis of the data. The regression analysis showed that the exploratory questions and cumulative reasoning factors explained together 26% of the variance of the tutorial groups productivity. This study provided evidence for the validity of the questionnaire. The instrument contains tips for students and tutors to stimulate deep processing interactions in the tutorial group. Nevertheless it seems useful to investigate the external validity of the questionnaire." Development and validation of a questionnaire to identify learning-oriented group interactions in PBL.
