Human falls are a global public health issue resulting in over 37.3 million severe injuries and 646000 deaths yearly. Falls result in direct financial cost to health systems and indirectly to society productivity. Unsurprisingly human fall detection and prevention are a major focus of health research. In this article we consider deep learning for fall detection in an IoT and fog computing environment. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network composed of three convolutional layers two maxpool and three fully-connected layers as our deep learning model. We evaluate its performance using three open data sets and against extant research. Our approach for resolving dimensionality and modelling simplicity issues is outlined. Accuracy precision sensitivity specificity and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient are used to evaluate performance. The best results are achieved when using data augmentation during the training process. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and future directions for research in this domain. Accelerometer-Based Human Fall Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks.
