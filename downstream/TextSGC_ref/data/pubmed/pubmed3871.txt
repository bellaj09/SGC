Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD is currently diagnosed by a diagnostic interview mainly based on subjective reports from parents or teachers. It is necessary to develop methods that rely on objectively measureable neurobiological data to assess brain-behavior relationship in patients with ADHD. We investigated the application of a topological data analysis tool Mapper to analyze the brain functional connectivity data from ADHD patients. A New Approach to Investigate the Association between Brain Functional Connectivity and Disease Characteristics of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Topological Neuroimaging Data Analysis.
