A virtual reality VR neurosurgical simulator with haptic feedback may provide the best model for training and perfecting surgical techniques for transsphenoidal approaches to the sella turcica and cranial base. Currently there are 2 commercially available simulators: NeuroTouch Cranio and Endo developed by the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with surgeons at teaching hospitals in Canada and the Immersive Touch. Work in progress on other simulators at additional institutions is currently unpublished. The development of a virtual simulator for training neurosurgeons to perform and perfect endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery.
