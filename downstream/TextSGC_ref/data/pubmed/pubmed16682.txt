This paper presents a generalized framework for dynamic simulation realized in a prototype simulator called the Interactive Generalized Motion Simulator I-GMS which can simulate motions of multirigid-body systems with contact interaction in virtual environments. I-GMS is designed to meet two important goals: generality and interactivity. By generality we mean a dynamic simulator which can easily support various systems of rigid bodies ranging from a single free-flying rigid object to complex linkages such as those needed for robotic systems or human body simulation. To provide this generality we have developed I-GMS in an object-oriented framework. The user interactivity is supported through a haptic interface for articulated bodies introducing interactive dynamic simulation schemes. This user-interaction is achieved by performing push and pull operations via the PHANToM haptic device which runs as an integrated part of I-GMS. Also a hybrid scheme was used for simulating internal contacts between bodies in the multirigid-body system in the presence of friction which could avoid the nonexistent solution problem often faced when solving contact problems with Coulomb friction. In our hybrid scheme two impulse-based methods are exploited so that different methods are applied adaptively depending on whether the current contact situation is characterized as "bouncing" or "steady." We demonstrate the user-interaction capability of I-GMS through on-line editing of trajectories of a 6-degree of freedom dof articulated structure.
