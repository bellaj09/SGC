"Recently a promising Brain-Computer Interface based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP-BCI was proposed which composed of two stimuli presented together in the center of the subjects field of view but at different depth planes Depth-of-Field setup. Thus users were easily able to select one of them by shifting their eye focus. However in that work EEG signals were collected through electrodes placed on occipital and parietal regions hair-covered areas which demanded a long preparation time. Also that work used low-frequency stimuli which can produce visual fatigue and increase the risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures. In order to improve the practicality and visual comfort this work proposes a BCI based on Depth-of-Field using the high-frequency SSVEP response measured from below-the-hairline areas behind-the-ears." Assessment of high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potentials from below-the-hairline areas for a brain-computer interface based on Depth-of-Field.
