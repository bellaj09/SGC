Rapid accurate prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence would accelerate fields as diverse as drug discovery synthetic biology and disease diagnosis. Massively improved prediction of protein structures has been driven by improving the prediction of the amino acid residues that contact in their 3D structure. For an average globular protein around 92% of all residue pairs are non-contacting therefore accurate prediction of only a small percentage of inter-amino acid distances could increase the number of constraints to guide structure determination. We have trained deep neural networks to predict inter-residue contacts and distances. Distances are predicted with an accuracy better than most contact prediction techniques. Addition of distance constraints improved de novo structure predictions for test sets of 158 protein structures as compared to using the best contact prediction methods alone. Importantly usage of distance predictions allows the selection of better models from the structure pool without a need for an external model assessment tool. The results also indicate how the accuracy of distance prediction methods might be improved further.
