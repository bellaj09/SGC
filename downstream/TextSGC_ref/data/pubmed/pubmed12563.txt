"The fields of human activity analysis have recently begun to diversify. Many researchers have taken much interest in developing action recognition or action prediction methods. The research on human action evaluation differs by aiming to design computation models and evaluation approaches for automatically assessing the quality of human actions. This line of study has become popular because of its explosively emerging real-world applications such as physical rehabilitation assistive living for elderly people skill training on self-learning platforms and sports activity scoring. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of approaches and techniques in action evaluation research including motion detection and preprocessing using skeleton data handcrafted feature representation methods and deep learning-based feature representation methods. The benchmark datasets from this research field and some evaluation criteria employed to validate the algorithms performance are introduced. Finally the authors present several promising future directions for further studies." A Survey of Vision-Based Human Action Evaluation Methods.
