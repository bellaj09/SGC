In rehabilitation assistive and space robotics the capability to track the body posture of a user in real time is highly desirable. In more specific cases such as teleoperated extra-vehicular activity prosthetics and home service robotics the ideal posture-tracking device must also be wearable light and low-power while still enforcing the best possible accuracy. Additionally the device must be targeted at effective human-machine interaction. In this paper we present and test such a device based upon commercial inertial measurement units: it weighs 575 grams in total lasts up to 10.5 hours of continual operation can be donned and doffed in under a minute and costs less than 290 EUR. We assess the attainable performance in terms of error in an online trajectory-tracking task in Virtual Reality using the device through an experiment involving 10 subjects showing that an average user can attain a precision of 0.66 cm during a static precision task and 6.33 cm while tracking a moving trajectory when tested in the full peri-personal space of a user.
