The programmable nature of smart textiles makes them an indispensable part of an emerging new technology field. Smart textile-integrated microelectronic systems STIMES which combine microelectronics and technology such as artificial intelligence and augmented or virtual reality have been intensively explored. A vast range of research activities have been reported. Many promising applications in healthcare the internet of things IoT smart city management robotics etc. have been demonstrated around the world. A timely overview and comprehensive review of progress of this field in the last five years are provided. Several main aspects are covered: functional materials major fabrication processes of smart textile components functional devices system architectures and heterogeneous integration wearable applications in human and nonhuman-related areas and the safety and security of STIMES. The major types of textile-integrated nonconventional functional devices are discussed in detail: sensors actuators displays antennas energy harvesters and their hybrids batteries and supercapacitors circuit boards and memory devices.
