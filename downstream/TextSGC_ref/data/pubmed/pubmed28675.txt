In this study cortical oscillatory dynamics with respect to tactile selective sensation tasks were investigated. Subjects were required to perform three tactile attention tasks prompted by cues presented in random order and while both wrists were simultaneously stimulated: 1 selective sensation of the left hand SS-L 2 selective sensation of the right hand SS-R 3 bilateral selective sensation SS-B. Even-related desynchronization ERD/ERS analysis revealed a clear contralateral activation of somatosensory cortex during the SS-L and SS-R tasks and a bilateral activation during SS-B tasks. Additionally we found a clear ERS in occipital region of the brain during all the SS tasks. Diverse activation pattern among SS-L SS-R and SS-B offers novel brain signals for somatosensory Brain-computer Interfaces.
