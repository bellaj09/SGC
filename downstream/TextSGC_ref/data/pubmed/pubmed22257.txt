Post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD can occur in the wake of exposure to a traumatic event. Currently PTSD symptoms are assessed mainly through self-report in the form of questionnaire or clinical interview. Self-report has inherent limitations particularly in psychiatric populations who may have limited awareness of deficit reduced attention span or poor vocabulary and/or literacy skills. Diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy would be aided by behavioral measures. A viable alternative may be virtual environments in which the participant guides an on-screen "avatar" through a series of onscreen events meant to simulate real-world situations. Here a sample of 82 veterans self-assessed for PTSD symptoms was administered such a task in which the avatar was confronted with situations that might evoke avoidant behavior a core feature of PTSD. Results showed a strong correlation between PTSD symptom burden and task performance; in fact the ability to predict PTSD symptom burden based on simple demographic variables age sex combat exposure was significantly improved by adding task score as a predictor variable. The results therefore suggest that virtual environments may provide a new way to assess PTSD symptoms while avoiding at least some of the limitations associated with symptom self-report and thus might be a useful complement to questionnaire or clinical interview potentially facilitating both diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Beyond symptom self-report: use of a computer "avatar" to assess post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD symptoms.
