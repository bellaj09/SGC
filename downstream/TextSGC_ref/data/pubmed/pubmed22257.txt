Repetitive practice improves function and facilitates cortical plasticity after stroke. Virtual reality VR systems have the potential to provide motivating and safe repetitive practice with minimal supervision. The purpose of this case study is to look at the effect of a VR system activated by surface electromyography of dorsiflexors and plantarflexors on gait velocity function and kinematics. An ankle to computer virtual reality system for improving gait and function in a person 9 months poststroke.
