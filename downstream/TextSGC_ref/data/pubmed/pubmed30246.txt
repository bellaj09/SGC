Permanent injury to the cranial nerves can often result in a substantial reduction in quality of life. Novel and innovative interventions can help restore form and function in nerve paralysis with bioelectric interfaces among the more promising of these approaches. The foreign body response is an important consideration for any bioelectric device as it influences the function and effectiveness of the implant. The purpose of this review is to describe tissue and functional effects of chronic neural implantation among the different categories of neural implants and highlight advances in peripheral and cranial nerve stimulation. Data Sources: PubMed IEEE and Web of Science literature search. Review Methods: A review of the current literature was conducted to examine functional and histologic effects of bioelectric interfaces for neural implants. Functional and Histological Effects of Chronic Neural Electrode Implantation.
