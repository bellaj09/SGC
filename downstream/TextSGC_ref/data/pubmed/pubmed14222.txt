The classification of benign versus malignant breast lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI is a challenging task since breast lesions are heterogeneous and complex. Recently deep learning methods have been used for breast lesion diagnosis with raw image input. However without the guidance of domain knowledge these data-driven methods cannot ensure that the features extracted from images are comprehensive for breast cancer diagnosis. Specifically these features are difficult to relate to clinically relevant phenomena. A knowledge-driven feature learning and integration method for breast cancer diagnosis on multi-sequence MRI.
