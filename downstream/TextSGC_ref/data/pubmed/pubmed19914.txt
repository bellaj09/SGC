Despite the plethora of weight loss programs available in the US the prevalence of overweight and obesity BMI25kg/m2 among US adults continues to rise at least in part due to the high probability of weight regain following weight loss. Thus the development and evaluation of novel interventions designed to improve weight maintenance are clearly needed. Virtual reality environments offer a promising platform for delivering weight maintenance interventions as they provide rapid feedback learner experimentation real-time personalized task selection and exploration. Utilizing virtual reality during weight maintenance allows individuals to engage in repeated experiential learning practice skills and participate in real-life scenarios without real-life repercussions which may diminish weight regain. We will conduct an 18-month effectiveness trial 6 months weight loss 12 months weight maintenance in 202 overweight/obese adults BMI 25-44.9kg/m2. Participants who achieve 5% weight loss following a 6month weight loss intervention delivered by phone conference call will be randomized to weight maintenance interventions delivered by conference call or conducted in a virtual environment Second Life. The primary aim of the study is to compare weight change during maintenance between the phone conference call and virtual groups. Secondarily potential mediators of weight change including energy and macronutrient intake physical activity consumption of fruits and vegetables self-efficacy for both physical activity and diet and attendance and completion of experiential learning assignments will also be assessed.
