"Human faces contain multiple sources of information. During speech perception visual information from the talkers mouth is integrated with auditory information from the talkers voice. By directly recording neural responses from small populations of neurons in patients implanted with subdural electrodes we found enhanced visual cortex responses to speech when auditory speech was absent rendering visual speech especially relevant. Receptive field mapping demonstrated that this enhancement was specific to regions of the visual cortex with retinotopic representations of the mouth of the talker. Connectivity between frontal cortex and other brain regions was measured with trial-by-trial power correlations. Strong connectivity was observed between frontal cortex and mouth regions of visual cortex; connectivity was weaker between frontal cortex and non-mouth regions of visual cortex or auditory cortex. These results suggest that top-down selection of visual information from the talkers mouth by frontal cortex plays an important role in audiovisual speech perception."
