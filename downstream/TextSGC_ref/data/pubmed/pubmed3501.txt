"This work examines the effect of midazolam-induced light sedation on intrinsic functional connectivity of human brain using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over within-subject design. Fourteen healthy young subjects were enrolled and midazolam 0.03 mg/kg of the participants body mass to a maximum of 2.5 mg or saline were administrated with an interval of one week. Resting-state fMRI was conducted before and after administration for each subject. We focus on two types of networks: sensory related lower-level functional networks and higher-order functions related ones. Independent component analysis ICA was used to identify these resting-state functional networks. We hypothesize that the sensory visual auditory and sensorimotor related networks will be intact under midazolam-induced light sedation while the higher-order default mode executive control salience networks etc. networks will be functionally disconnected. It was found that the functional integrity of the lower-level networks was maintained while that of the higher-level networks was significantly disrupted by light sedation. The within-network connectivity of the two types of networks was differently affected in terms of direction and extent. These findings provide direct evidence that higher-order cognitive functions including memory attention executive function and language were impaired prior to lower-level sensory responses during sedation. Our result also lends support to the information integration model of consciousness." Disruption of cortical integration during midazolam-induced light sedation.
