Understanding the cell-specific binding patterns of transcription factors TFs is fundamental to studying gene regulatory networks in biological systems for which ChIP-seq not only provides valuable data but is also considered as the gold standard. Despite tremendous efforts from the scientific community to conduct TF ChIP-seq experiments the available data represent only a limited percentage of ChIP-seq experiments considering all possible combinations of TFs and cell lines. In this study we demonstrate a method for accurately predicting cell-specific TF binding for TF-cell line combinations based on only a small fraction 4% of the combinations using available ChIP-seq data. The proposed model termed TFImpute is based on a deep neural network with a multi-task learning setting to borrow information across transcription factors and cell lines. Compared with existing methods TFImpute achieves comparable accuracy on TF-cell line combinations with ChIP-seq data; moreover TFImpute achieves better accuracy on TF-cell line combinations without ChIP-seq data. This approach can predict cell line specific enhancer activities in K562 and HepG2 cell lines as measured by massively parallel reporter assays and predicts the impact of SNPs on TF binding.
