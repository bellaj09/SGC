The number of robotic surgical procedures has been increasing worldwide. It is important to maximize the cost-effectiveness of robotic surgical training and safely reduce the time needed for trainees to reach proficiency. The use of preliminary lab training in robotic skills is a good strategy for the rapid acquisition of further standardized robotic skills. Such training can be done either by using a simulator or by exercises in a dry or wet lab. While the use of an actual robotic surgical system for training may be problematic high cost lack of availability virtual reality VR simulators can overcome many of these obstacles. However there is still a lack of standardization. Although VR training systems have improved they cannot yet replace experience in a wet lab. In particular simulated scenarios are not yet close enough to a real operative experience. Indeed there is a difference between technical skills i.e. mechanical ability to perform a simulated task and surgical competence i.e. ability to perform a real surgical operation. Thus while a VR simulator can replace a dry lab it cannot yet replace training in a wet lab or operative training in actual patients. However in the near future it is expected that VR surgical simulators will be able to provide total reality simulation and replace training in a wet lab. More research is needed to produce more wide-ranging trans-specialty robotic curricula. Virtual Reality Simulator Systems in Robotic Surgical Training.
