Medical simulation is a rapidly expanding area within medical education due to advances in technology significant reduction in training hours and increased procedural complexity. Simulation training aims to enhance patient safety through improved technical competency and eliminating human factors in a risk free environment. It is particularly applicable to a practical procedure-orientated specialties. Simulation can be useful for novice trainees experienced clinicians e.g. for revalidation and team building. It has become a cornerstone in the delivery of medical education being a paradigm shift in how doctors are educated and trained. Simulation must take a proactive position in the development of metric-based simulation curriculum adoption of proficiency benchmarking definitions and should not depend on the simulation platforms used. Conversely ingraining of poor practice may occur in the absence of adequate supervision and equipment malfunction during the simulation can break the immersion and disrupt any learning that has occurred. Despite the presence of high technology there is a substantial learning curve for both learners and facilitators. The technology of simulation continues to advance offering devices capable of improved fidelity in virtual reality simulation more sophisticated procedural practice and advanced patient simulators. Simulation-based training has also brought about paradigm shifts in the medical and surgical education arenas and ensured that the scope and impact of simulation will continue to broaden.
