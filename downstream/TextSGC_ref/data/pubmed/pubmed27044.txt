"We present a methodology for a hybrid brain-computer interface BCI system with the recognition of motor imagery MI based on EEG and blink EOG signals. We tested the BCI system in a 3D Tetris and an analogous 2D game playing environment. To enhance players BCI control ability the study focused on feature extraction from EEG and control strategy supporting Game-BCI system operation. We compared the numerical differences between spatial features extracted with common spatial pattern CSP and the proposed multifeature extraction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D game environment at enhancing players event-related desynchronization ERD and event-related synchronization ERS production ability we set the 2D Screen Game as the comparison experiment. According to a series of statistical results the group performing MI in the 3D Tetris environment showed more significant improvements in generating MI-associated ERD/ERS. Analysis results of game-score indicated that the players scores presented an obvious uptrend in 3D Tetris environment but did not show an obvious downward trend in 2D Screen Game. It suggested that the immersive and rich-control environment for MI would improve the associated mental imagery and enhance MI-based BCI skills."
