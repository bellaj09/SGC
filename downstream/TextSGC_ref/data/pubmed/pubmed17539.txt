Users of compact smart products with small screens often have trouble learning the menu structure. If they cannot master the menu structure users are not able to fully utilize the products. It is argued in this paper that using visual momentum in menu representation design helps users develop effective mental maps of menu structures and promotes learning of the user interface. To assess the effect of visual momentum in this study four types of menu representations were developed. Additionally two menu hierarchies two types of function key layout and two types of function key labeling were assessed to examine the effects of menu dimension and compatibility. Experimental results indicated that participants using a partial menu map with visual momentum design performed the best and participants using a partial menu map without visual momentum performed the poorest even worse than those-using command-only representation. The results also showed that the menu navigation problem appeared to be particularly significant with a deep menu hierarchy. Actual or potential applications of this research include menu representation design for compact smart products. Menu design with visual momentum for compact smart products.
