Patients with schizophrenia are predisposed toward developing cardiovascular disease. Although neuroleptics affect the cardiovascular system it is also important to consider the consequences of the disease itself such as lower physical activity due to living on disability pension inadequate nutrition and/or nicotine addiction being more common among patients with schizophrenia versus the general population. All these factors combined lead to an increased risk of death caused by cardiovascular conditions in schizophrenic patients. Individuals receiving typical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to have elevated concentrations of antiphospholipid antibodies including anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies. The presence of both antibodies is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolism. It is also likely that mental illness is accompanied by increased procoagulant activity. Patients with acute psychosis have been shown to have a statistically significant increase in the concentrations of D-dimer P-selectin and in the expression of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. Learning about causes and mechanisms of venous thromboembolism could help to reduce or neutralize the adverse effects of antipsychotic treatment and facilitate the identification of appropriate markers necessary to monitor changes and provide preventive care against hazardous and potentially fatal complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Before atypical neuroleptic treatment is administered to hospitalized patients all possible risk factors for thromboembolism should be considered to allow the application of lower risk drugs. Also other preventive measures should be taken into account including hydration compression stockings regular exercise of lower extremities and low-molecular-weight heparin injections. The impact of antipsychotics as a risk factor for thromboembolism.
