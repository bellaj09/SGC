Alzheimer disease AD is characterized by neurodegeneration marked by loss of synapses and spines associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Accumulating amyloid  peptide A in brain is linked to neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in AD. Here we identify 2-adrenergic receptor 2AR that mediates A-induced tau pathology. In the prefrontal cortex PFC of 1-year-old transgenic mice with human familial mutant genes of presenilin 1 and amyloid precursor protein PS1/APP the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214 Ser-262 and Thr-181 and the protein kinases including JNK GSK3/ and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is increased significantly. Deletion of the 2AR gene in PS1/APP mice greatly decreases the phosphorylation of these proteins. Further analysis reveals that in primary PFC neurons A signals through a 2AR-PKA-JNK pathway which is responsible for most of the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214 and Ser-262 and a significant portion of phosphorylation at Thr-181. A also induces a 2AR-dependent arrestin-ERK1/2 activity that does not participate in phosphorylation of tau. However inhibition of the activity of MEK an upstream enzyme of ERK1/2 partially blocks A-induced tau phosphorylation at Thr-181. The density of dendritic spines and synapses is decreased in the deep layer of the PFC of 1-year-old PS1/APP mice and the mice exhibit impairment of learning and memory in a novel object recognition paradigm. Deletion of the 2AR gene ameliorates pathological effects in these senile PS1/APP mice. The study indicates that 2AR may represent a potential therapeutic target for preventing the development of AD. 2 adrenergic receptor protein kinase A PKA and c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK signaling pathways mediate tau pathology in Alzheimer disease models.
