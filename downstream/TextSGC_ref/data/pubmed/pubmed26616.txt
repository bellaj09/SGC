In this study an analysis system embedding neuron-fuzzy prediction in feature extraction is proposed for brain-computer interface BCI applications. Wavelet-fractal features combined with neuro-fuzzy predictions are applied for feature extraction in motor imagery MI discrimination. The features are extracted from the electroencephalography EEG signals recorded from participants performing left and right MI. Time-series predictions are performed by training 2 adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems ANFIS for respective left and right MI data. Features are then calculated from the difference in multi-resolution fractal feature vector MFFV between the predicted and actual signals through a window of EEG signals. Finally the support vector machine is used for classification. The proposed method estimates its performance in comparison with the linear adaptive autoregressive AAR model and the AAR time-series prediction of 6 participants from 2 data sets. The results indicate that the proposed method is promising in MI classification. Embedded prediction in feature extraction: application to single-trial EEG discrimination.
