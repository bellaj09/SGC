We present a computer-based medical training workstation for the simulation of intraocular eye surgery. The surgeon manipulates two original instruments inside a mechanical model of the eye. The instrument positions are tracked by CCD cameras and monitored by a PC which renders the scenery using a computer-graphic model of the eye and the instruments. The simulator incorporates a model of the operation table a mechanical eye three CCD cameras for the position tracking the stereo display and a computer. The three cameras are mounted under the operation table from where they can observe the interior of the mechanical eye. Using small markers the cameras recognize the instruments and the eye. Their position and orientation in space is determined by stereoscopic back projection. The simulation runs with more than 20 frames per second and provides a realistic impression of the surgery. It includes the cold light source which can be moved inside the eye and the shadow of the instruments on the retina which is important for navigational purposes. Virtual reality in ophthalmological education.
