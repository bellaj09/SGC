Machine learning is an attractive paradigm to circumvent difficulties associated with the development and optimization of force-field parameters. In this study a deep neural network DNN is used to study the inverse problem of the liquid-state theory in particular to obtain the relation between the radial distribution function RDF and the Lennard-Jones LJ potential parameters at various thermodynamic states. Using molecular dynamics MD many observables including RDF are determined once the interatomic potential is specified. However the inverse problem parametrization of the potential for a specific RDF is not straightforward. Here we present a framework integrating DNN with big data from 1.5 TB of MD trajectories with a cumulative simulation time of 52 s for 26\u202f000 distinct systems to predict LJ potential parameters. Our results show that DNN is successful not only in the parametrization of the atomic LJ liquids but also in parametrizing the LJ potential for coarse-grained models of simple multiatom molecules.
