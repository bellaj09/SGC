"White matter characterization studies use the information provided by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI to draw cross-population inferences. However the structure function and white matter geometry vary across individuals. Here we propose a subject fingerprint called Fiberprint to quantify the individual uniqueness in white matter geometry using fiber trajectories. We learn a sparse coding representation for fiber trajectories by mapping them to a common space defined by a dictionary. A subject fingerprint is then generated by applying a pooling function for each bundle thus providing a vector of bundle-wise features describing a particular subjects white matter geometry. These features encode unique properties of fiber trajectories such as their density along prominent bundles. An analysis of data from 861 Human Connectome Project subjects reveals that a fingerprint based on approximately 3000 fiber trajectories can uniquely identify exemplars from the same individual. We also use fingerprints for twin/sibling identification our observations consistent with the twin data studies of white matter integrity. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Fiberprint can effectively capture the variability in white matter fiber geometry across individuals using a compact feature vector dimension of 50 making this framework particularly attractive for handling large datasets."
