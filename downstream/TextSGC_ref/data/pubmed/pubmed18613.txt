"Virtual reality VR promises methodological rigour with the extra benefit of allowing us to study the context-dependent behaviour of individuals in their natural environment. Pan and Hamilton 2018 Br. J. Psychol. provide a useful overview of methodological recommendations for using VR. Here we highlight some other aspects of the use of VR. Our first argument is that VR can be useful by virtue of its differences from the normal perceptual environment. That is by virtue of its relative non-realism and poverty of its perceptual elements it can actually offer increased clarity with respect to the features of interest for the researcher. Our second argument is that VR exerts its measurable influence more by eliciting an acceptance of the virtual world i.e. suspension of disbelief rather than by eliciting a true belief of the realism of the VR environment. We conclude by providing a novel suggestion for combining neuroimaging methods with embodied VR that relies on the suspension of disbelief." Virtual reality and the new psychophysics.
