A traditional structural analysis of scaffolding structures requires loading conditions that are only possible during design but not in operation. Thus this study proposes a method that can be used during operation to make an automated safety prediction for scaffolds. It implements a divide-and-conquer technique with deep learning. As a test scaffolding a four-bay three-story scaffold model was used. Analysis of the model led to 1411 unique safety cases for the model. To apply deep learning a test simulation generated 1540000 datasets for pre-training and an additional 141100 datasets for testing purposes. The cases were then sub-divided into 18 categories based on failure modes at both global and local levels along with a combination of member failures. Accordingly the divide-and-conquer technique was applied to the 18 categories each of which were pre-trained by a neural network. For the test datasets the overall accuracy was 99%. The prediction model showed that 82.78% of the 1411 safety cases showed 100% accuracy for the test datasets which contributed to the high accuracy. In addition the higher values of precision recall and F1 score for the majority of the safety cases indicate good performance of the model and a significant improvement compared with past research conducted on simpler cases. Specifically the method demonstrated improved performance with respect to accuracy and the number of classifications. Thus the results suggest that the methodology could be reliably applied for the safety assessment of scaffolding systems that are more complex than systems tested in past studies. Furthermore the implemented methodology can easily be replicated for other classification problems. Multi-Level-Phase Deep Learning Using Divide-and-Conquer for Scaffolding Safety.
