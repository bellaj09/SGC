The complement system C1q/C3 is a key mediator of synaptic pruning during normal development. HIV inappropriately induces C1q and C3 production in the brain and reduces neuronal complement inhibition. HIV may thus alter neural connectivity in the developing brain by excessively targeting synapses for elimination. The resultant pattern of neuronal injury may fundamentally alter neurodevelopmental and cognitive processes differentially across ages. This study aimed to 1 measure the association between the cerebrospinal fluid CSF complement factors C1q/C3 and a marker of neuronal injury NFL in HIV+ subjects; 2 quantify the differences in CSF C1q/C3 between HIV+ youth and older adults; and 3 define the relationship between CSF C1q/C3 and cognitive impairment in each age group. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of 20 HIV+ 18-24-year-old youth and 20 HIV+ 40-46-year-old adults with varying levels of cognitive impairment enrolled in the CNS Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research study. We quantified C3 C1q and NFL by ELISA in paired CSF/plasma specimens. We found that CSF C1q correlates with NFL in all subjects not receiving antiretroviral therapy n\xa0=\xa016 rho\xa0=\xa00.53 p\xa0=\xa00.035 when extreme NFL outliers were eliminated n\xa0=\xa01. There was no difference in plasma/CSF C1q or C3 between older adults and youth. In 18-24-year-old youth a nearly significant p\xa0=\xa00.052 elevation of CSF C1q expression was observed in cognitively impaired subjects compared to cognitively normal subjects. Further investigation into the role of the CNS complement system in the neuropathogenesis of HIV is warranted and should be considered in a developmentally specific context.
