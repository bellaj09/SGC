The surface electromyography sEMG-based gesture recognition with deep learning approach plays an increasingly important role in human-computer interaction. Existing deep learning architectures are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Network CNN architecture which captures spatial information of electromyogram signal. Motivated by the sequential nature of electromyogram signal we propose an attention-based hybrid CNN and RNN CNN-RNN architecture to better capture temporal properties of electromyogram signal for gesture recognition problem. Moreover we present a new sEMG image representation method based on a traditional feature vector which enables deep learning architectures to extract implicit correlations between different channels for sparse multi-channel electromyogram signal. Extensive experiments on five sEMG benchmark databases show that the proposed method outperforms all reported state-of-the-art methods on both sparse multi-channel and high-density sEMG databases. To compare with the existing works we set the window length to 200ms for NinaProDB1 and NinaProDB2 and 150ms for BioPatRec sub-database CapgMyo sub-database and csl-hdemg databases. The recognition accuracies of the aforementioned benchmark databases are 87.0% 82.2% 94.1% 99.7% and 94.5% which are 9.2% 3.5% 1.2% 0.2% and 5.2% higher than the state-of-the-art performance respectively.
