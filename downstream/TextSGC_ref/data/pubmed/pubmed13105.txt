"Mild cognitive impairment MCI is the early stage of Alzheimers disease AD. Automatic diagnosis of MCI by magnetic resonance imaging MRI images has been the focus of research in recent years. Furthermore deep learning models based on 2D view and 3D view have been widely used in the diagnosis of MCI. The deep learning architecture can capture anatomical changes in the brain from MRI scans to extract the underlying features of brain disease. In this paper we propose a multi-view based multi-model MVMM learning framework which effectively combines the local information of 2D images with the global information of 3D images. First we select some 2D slices from MRI images and extract the features representing 2D local information. Then we combine them with the features representing 3D global information learned from 3D images to train the MVMM learning framework. We evaluate our model on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI database. The experimental results show that our proposed model can effectively recognize MCI through MRI images accuracy of 87.50% for MCI/HC and accuracy of 83.18% for MCI/AD."
