In humans spontaneous movements are often preceded by early brain signals. One such signal is the readiness potential RP that gradually arises within the last second preceding a movement. An important question is whether people are able to cancel movements after the elicitation of such RPs and if so until which point in time. Here subjects played a game where they tried to press a button to earn points in a challenge with a brain-computer interface BCI that had been trained to detect their RPs in real time and to emit stop signals. Our data suggest that subjects can still veto a movement even after the onset of the RP. Cancellation of movements was possible if stop signals occurred earlier than 200 ms before movement onset thus constituting a point of no return. The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements.
