This study examined the feasibility of Enzogenol as a potential treatment modality for concussed individuals with residual symptoms in the chronic phase. Forty-two student-athletes with history of sport-related concussion were enrolled comparing Enzogenol versus placebo. Testing was conducted using virtual reality VR and electroencephalography EEG with neuropsychological NP tasks primarily used to induce cognitive challenges. After six weeks the Enzogenol group showed enhanced frontal-midline theta and decreased parietal theta power indicating reduced mental fatigue. Subjects enrolled in the Enzogenol group also self-reported reduced mental fatigue and sleep problems. This suggests that Enzogenol has the potential to improve brain functioning in the chronic phase of concussion.
