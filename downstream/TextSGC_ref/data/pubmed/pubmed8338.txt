In this study a novel illuminant color estimation framework is proposed for computational color constancy which incorporates the high representational capacity of deep-learningbased models and the great interpretability of assumptionbased models. The well-designed building block feature map reweight unit ReWU helps to achieve comparative accuracy on benchmark datasets with respect to prior state-of-the-art deep learning based models while requiring more compact model size and cheaper computational cost. In addition to local color estimation a confidence estimation branch is also included such that the model is able to simultaneously produce point estimate and its uncertainty estimate which provides useful clues for local estimates aggregation and multiple illumination estimation. The source code and the dataset have been made available1. Color Constancy by Reweighting Image Feature Maps.
