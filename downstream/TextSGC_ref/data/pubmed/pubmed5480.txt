"Spatiotemporal tau pathology progression is regarded as highly stereotyped within each type of degenerative condition. For instance AD has a progression of tau pathology consistently beginning in the entorhinal cortex the locus coeruleus and other nearby noradrenergic brainstem nuclei before spreading to the rest of the limbic system as well as the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Proposed explanations for the consistent spatial patterns of tau pathology progression as well as for why certain regions are selectively vulnerable to exhibiting pathology over the course of disease generally focus on transsynaptic spread proceeding via the brains anatomic connectivity network in a cell-independent manner or on cell-intrinsic properties that might render some cell populations or regions uniquely vulnerable. We test connectivity based explanations of spatiotemporal tau pathology progression and regional vulnerability against cell-intrinsic explanation using regional gene expression profiles as a proxy. We find that across both exogenously seeded and non-seeded tauopathic mouse models the connectivity network provides a better explanation than regional gene expression profiles even when such profiles are limited to specific sets of tau risk-related genes only. Our results suggest that regardless of the location of pathology initiation tau pathology progression is well characterized by a model positing entirely cell-type and molecular environment independent transsynaptic spread via the mouse brains connectivity network. These results further suggest that regional vulnerability to tau pathology is mainly governed by connectivity with regions already exhibiting pathology rather than by cell-intrinsic factors." Connectivity not region-intrinsic properties predicts regional vulnerability to progressive tau pathology in mouse models of disease.
