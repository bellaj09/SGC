Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery NOTES is a newer field of endoscopic surgery that allows for scarless treatment of pathologic entities using novel transluminal approaches. There has been a shift of focus from a clinical and research standpoint from the development and dissemination of "first-generation" NOTES procedures to "new NOTES" procedures that traverse the mucosa of luminal structures yet do not stray far into the peritoneal cavity. It has been a challenge to find appropriate and effective ways to train gastroenterologists and surgeons in these novel approaches. We review the importance of simulation in training and discuss available simulation options. Pre-clinical Training for New Notes Procedures: From Ex-vivo Models to Virtual Reality Simulators.
