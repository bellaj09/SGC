Deep-sea alvinellid worm species endemic to hydrothermal vents such as Alvinella and Paralvinella are considered to be among the most thermotolerant animals known with their adaptability to toxic heavy metals and tolerance of highly reductive and oxidative stressful environments. Despite the number of recent studies focused on their overall transcriptomic proteomic and metabolic stabilities little is known regarding their sensory receptor cells and electrically active neuro-processing centers and how these can tolerate and function in such harsh conditions. Sensing deep extreme environments: the receptor cell types brain centers and multi-layer neural packaging of hydrothermal vent endemic worms.
