Traditional drug discovery and development are often time-consuming and high risk. Repurposing/repositioning of approved drugs offers a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach toward rapid development of efficacious treatments. The emergence of large-scale heterogeneous biological networks has offered unprecedented opportunities for developing in silico drug repositioning approaches. However capturing highly non-linear heterogeneous network structures by most existing approaches for drug repositioning has been challenging. deepDR: a network-based deep learning approach to in silico drug repositioning.
