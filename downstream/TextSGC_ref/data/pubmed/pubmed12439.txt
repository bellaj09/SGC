MicroRNAs miRNAs are the major class of gene-regulating molecules that bind mRNAs. They function mainly as translational repressors in mammals. Therefore how to identify miRNAs is one of the most important problems in medical treatment. Many known pre-miRNAs have a hairpin ring structure containing more structural features and it is difficult to identify mature miRNAs because of their short length. Therefore most research focuses on the identification of pre-miRNAs. Most computational models rely on manual feature extraction to identify pre-miRNAs and do not consider the sequential and spatial characteristics of pre-miRNAs resulting in a loss of information. As the number of unidentified pre-miRNAs is far greater than that of known pre-miRNAs there is a dataset imbalance problem which leads to a degradation of the performance of pre-miRNA identification methods. In order to overcome the limitations of existing methods we propose a pre-miRNA identification algorithm based on a cascaded CNN-LSTM framework called CL-PMI. We used a convolutional neural network to automatically extract features and obtain pre-miRNA spatial information. We also employed long short-term memory LSTM to capture time characteristics of pre-miRNAs and improve attention mechanisms for long-term dependence modeling. Focal loss was used to improve the dataset imbalance. Compared with existing methods CL-PMI achieved better performance on all datasets. The results demonstrate that this method can effectively identify pre-miRNAs by simultaneously considering their spatial and sequential information as well as dealing with imbalance in the datasets.
