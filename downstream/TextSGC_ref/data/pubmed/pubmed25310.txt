"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs aim to provide a means for people with severe motor disabilities to control their environment directly with neural activity. In intracortical BCIs for people with tetraplegia the decoder that maps neural activity to desired movements has typically been calibrated using open-loop OL imagination of control while a cursor automatically moves to targets on a computer screen. However because neural activity can vary across contexts a decoder calibrated using OL data may not be optimal for closed-loop CL neural control. Here we tested whether CL calibration creates a better decoder than OL calibration even when all other factors that might influence performance are held constant including the amount of data used for calibration and the amount of elapsed time between calibration and testing."
