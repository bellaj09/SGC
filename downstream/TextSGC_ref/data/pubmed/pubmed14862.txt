Inferior vena cava IVC filters are often used to treat deep vein thrombosis. IVC filters may become difficult to extract because of adhesion around the device and those permanently left inside the patient may cause injurious complications. We describe a novel IVC filter extraction technique using pacemaker lead extraction tools. A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis by computed tomography received an IVC filter Gunther Tulip Cook Medical Bloomington IN USA implantation for prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism. Eleven weeks later extraction of the IVC filter by a manual method and snaring technique was unsuccessful because of adhesion to the blood vessel wall. The patient was referred to our hospital for filter removal using pacemaker lead extraction tools. Extraction was performed in an operation room under general anesthesia in the presence of a cardiovascular surgeon to manage inadvertent perforation. Part of the adhered tissue around the four limbs of the filter was dissected using a 12 Fr laser sheath; protruding anchors were carefully dissected with a telescoping mechanical sheath using a counter-traction technique. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged without complications. A sophisticated removal procedure with pacemaker lead extraction tools can be used to remove problematic IVC filters. <Learning objective: Inferior vena cava IVC filters are often used to treat deep vein thrombosis. Although IVC filters are temporary implants they may become difficult to extract because of adhesion around the device. Many IVC filters that cannot be retrieved are permanently left inside the patient which may cause injurious complications. We describe a novel IVC filter extraction technique using pacemaker lead extraction tools and this technique can be helpful for the management of problematic IVC filters.>.
