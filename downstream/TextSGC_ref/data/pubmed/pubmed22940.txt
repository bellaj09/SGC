Conjugated polymer actuators have potential use in implantable neural interface devices for modulating the position of electrode sites within brain tissue or guiding insertion of neural probes along curved trajectories. The actuation of polypyrrole PPy doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonate DBS is characterized to ascertain whether it can be employed in the cerebral environment. Microfabricated bilayer beams are electrochemically cycled at either 22 or 37 C in aqueous NaDBS or in artificial cerebrospinal fluid aCSF. Nearly all the ions in aCSF are exchanged into the PPy-the cations Na+  K+  Mg2+  Ca2+  as well as the anion PO4 3- ; Cl- is not present. Nevertheless deflections in aCSF are comparable to those in NaDBS and they are monotonic with oxidation level: strain increases upon reduction with no reversal of motion despite the mixture of ionic charges and valences being exchanged. Actuation depends on temperature. Upon warming the cyclic voltammograms show additional peaks and an increase of 70% in the consumed charge. Bending is however much less affected: strain increases somewhat 6%-13% but remains monotonic and deflections shift up to 20%. These results show how the actuation environment must be taken into account and demonstrate proof of concept for actuated implantable neural interfaces.
