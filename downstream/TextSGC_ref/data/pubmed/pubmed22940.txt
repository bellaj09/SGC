Medical augmented reality has undergone much development recently. However there is a lack of studies quantitatively comparing the different display options available. This paper compares the effects of different graphical overlay systems in a simple micromanipulation task with "soft" visual servoing. We compared positioning accuracy in a real-time visually-guided task using Micron an active handheld tremor-canceling microsurgical instrument using three different displays: 2D screen 3D screen and microscope with monocular image injection. Tested with novices and an experienced vitreoretinal surgeon display of virtual cues in the microscope via an augmented reality injection system significantly decreased 3D error p &#60; 0.05 compared to the 2D and 3D monitors when confounding factors such as magnification level were normalized. Comparative evaluation of monocular augmented-reality display for surgical microscopes.
