"This paper introduces the technical foundations of a system designed to embed a lightweight faithful and spatially manipulable representation of the users hand into an otherwise virtual world - Augmented Virtuality AV. A highly intuitive control during pointing-like near space interaction can be provided to the user as well as a very flexible means to experimenters in a variety of non-medical and medical contexts. Our approach essentially relies on stereoscopic video see-through Augmented Reality AR technology and a generic extendible framework for managing 3-D visual hand displacements. Research from human-computer interaction perception and motor control has contributed to the elaboration of our proposal which combines a acting in co-location b avoiding occlusion violations by assuring a correct scene depth ordering and c providing a convincing visual feedback of the users hand. We further present two cases in which this system has already successfully been used and then outline some other applications that we think are promising for instance in the fields of neuromotor rehabilitation and experimental neuroscience."
