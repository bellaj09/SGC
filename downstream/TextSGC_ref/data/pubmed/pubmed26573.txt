Real-time computation portability and flexibility are crucial for practical brain-machine interface BMI applications. In this work we proposed Hardware Processing Modules HPMs as a method for accelerating BMI computation. Two HPMs have been developed. One is the field-programmable gate array FPGA implementation of spike sorting based on probabilistic neural network PNN and the other is the FPGA implementation of neural ensemble decoding based on Kalman filter KF. These two modules were configured under the same framework and tested with real data from motor cortex recording in rats performing a lever-pressing task for water rewards. Due to the parallelism feature of FPGA the computation time was reduced by several dozen times while the results are almost the same as those from Matlab implementations. Such HPMs provide a high performance coprocessor for neural signal computation. FPGA implementation of hardware processing modules as coprocessors in brain-machine interfaces.
