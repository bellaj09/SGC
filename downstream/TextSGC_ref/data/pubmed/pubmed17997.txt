"Until quite recently spinal disorder problems in the U.S. have been operated by fusing cervical vertebrae instead of replacement of the cervical disc with an artificial disc. Cervical disc replacement is a recently approved procedure in the U.S. It is one of the most challenging surgical procedures in the medical field due to the deficiencies in available diagnostic tools and insufficient number of surgical practices For physicians and surgical instrument developers it is critical to understand how to successfully deploy the new artificial disc replacement systems. Without proper understanding and practice of the deployment procedure it is possible to injure the vertebral body. Mixed reality MR and virtual reality VR surgical simulators are becoming an indispensable part of physicians training since they offer a risk free training environment. In this study MR simulation framework and intricacies involved in the development of a MR simulator for the rasping procedure in artificial cervical disc replacement ACDR surgery are investigated. The major components that make up the MR surgical simulator with motion tracking system are addressed."
