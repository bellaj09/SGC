"This study was performed to examine the psychometric properties of a Virtual-Reality Prospective Memory Test Hong Kong Chinese version; VRPMT-CV. The VRPMT was administered to 44 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia. The test was administered again 2 weeks later to establish test-retest reliability. The concurrent validity of the VRPMT was evaluated by examining the correlations between the VRPMT score and the score on the Chinese version of the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test CAMPROMPT-CV. The performance of individuals with schizophrenia on the VRPMT was also compared with that of 42 healthy control subjects to examine the tests sensitivity and specificity. The intraclass correlation for test-retest reliability of the total VRPMT-CV score was 0.78 p\u2009=\u2009.005. A significant correlation was found between the total VRPMT-CV score and the total CAMPROMPT-CV score r\u2009=\u20090.90; p\u2009<\u2009.001. Comparison with the healthy control subjects revealed that the total VRPMT-CV score was a sensitive 92.9% and specific 75% measure of prospective memory deficits in individuals with schizophrenia. The VRPMT-CV is an assessment of prospective memory that has good construct validity test-retest reliability sensitivity and specificity in the context of first-episode schizophrenia."
