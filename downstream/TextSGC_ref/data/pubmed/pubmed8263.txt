Rising concerns about the short- and long-term detrimental consequences of administration of conventional pharmacopeia are fueling the search for alternative complementary personalized and comprehensive approaches to human healthcare. Qigong a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine represents a viable alternative approach. Here we started with the practical philosophical and psychological background of Ki in Japanese or Qi in Chinese and their relationship to Qigong theory and clinical application. Noting the drawbacks of the current state of Qigong clinic herein we propose that to manage the unique aspects of the Eastern \non-linearity\ and \holistic\ approach it needs to be integrated with the Western "linearity" "one-direction" approach. This is done through developing the concepts of "Qigong breathing signatures" which can define our life breathing patterns associated with diseases using machine learning technology. We predict that this can be achieved by establishing an artificial intelligence AI-Medicine training camp of databases which will integrate Qigong-like breathing patterns with different pathologies unique to individuals. Such an integrated connection will allow the AI-Medicine algorithm to identify breathing patterns and guide medical intervention. This unique view of potentially connecting Eastern Medicine and Western Technology can further add a novel insight to our current understanding of both Western and Eastern medicine thereby establishing a vitality score index VSI that can predict the outcomes of lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions.
