"While it has been shown that the Global Optic Flow Rate GOFR is used in the control of self-motion speed this study examined its relevance in the control of interceptive actions while walking. We asked participants to intercept approaching targets by adjusting their walking speed in a virtual environment and predicted that the influence of the GOFR depended on their interception strategy. Indeed unlike the Constant Bearing Angle CBA the Modified Required Velocity MRV strategy relies on the perception of self-displacement speed. On the other hand the CBA strategy involves specific speed adjustments depending on the curvature of the targets trajectory whereas the MRV does not. We hypothesized that one strategy is selected among the two depending on the informational content of the environment. We thus manipulated the curvature and display of the targets trajectory and the relationship between physical walking speed and the GOFR through eye height manipulations. Our results showed that when the target trajectory was not displayed walking speed profiles were affected by curvature manipulations. Otherwise walking speed profiles were less affected by curvature manipulations and were affected by the GOFR manipulations. Taken together these results show that the use of the GOFR for intercepting a moving target while walking depends on the informational content of the environment. Finally we discuss the complementary roles of these two perceptual-motor strategies." Is perception of self-motion speed a necessary condition for intercepting a moving target while walking?
