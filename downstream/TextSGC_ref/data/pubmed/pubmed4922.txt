Type I Chiari malformation CMI is a radiologically-defined structural dysmorphism of the hindbrain and posterior cranial fossa PCF. Traditional radiographic identification of CMI relies on the measurement of the cerebellar tonsils in relation to the foramen magnum with or without associated abnormalities of the neuraxis. The primary goal of this retrospective study was to comprehensively assess morphometric parameters above the McRea line in a group of female CMI patients and normal controls. A morphometric assessment of type I Chiari malformation above the McRae line: A retrospective case-control study in 302 adult female subjects.
