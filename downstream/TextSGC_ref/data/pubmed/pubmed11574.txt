"We propose a deep learning model - Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients PPES-Met for estimating short-term life expectancy >3 months of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record while maintaining the temporal visit sequence. In a single framework we integrated semantic data mapping and neural embedding technique to produce a text processing method that extracts relevant information from heterogeneous types of clinical notes in an unsupervised manner and we designed a recurrent neural network to model the temporal dependency of the patient visits. The model was trained on a large dataset 10293 patients and validated on a separated dataset 1818 patients. Our method achieved an area under the ROC curve AUC of 0.89. To provide explain-ability we developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the models predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable our model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians."
