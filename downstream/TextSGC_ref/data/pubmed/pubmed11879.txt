For both pigs in commercial farms and biological experimental pigs at breeding bases mounting behaviour is likely to cause damage such as epidermal wounds lameness and fractures and will no doubt reduce animal welfare. The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient learning algorithm that is able to detect the mounting behaviour of pigs based on the data characteristics of visible light images. Four Gttingen minipigs were selected as experimental subjects and were monitored for a week by a camera that overlooked the pen. The acquired videos were analysed and the frames containing mounting behaviour were intercepted as positive samples of the dataset and the images with inter-pig adhesion and separated pigs were taken as negative samples. Pig segmentation network based on Mask Region-Convolutional Neural Networks Mask R-CNN was applied to extract individual pigs in the frames. The region of interest RoI parameters and mask coordinates of each pig from which eigenvectors were extracted could be obtained. Subsequently the eigenvectors were classified with a kernel extreme learning machine KELM to determine whether mounting behaviour has occurred. The pig segmentation presented considerable accuracy and mean pixel accuracy MPA with 94.92% and 0.8383 respectively. The presented method showed high accuracy sensitivity specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient with 91.47% 95.2% 88.34% and 0.8324 respectively. This method can be an efficient way of solving the problem of segmentation difficulty caused by partial occlusion and adhesion of pig bodies even if the pig body colour was similar to the background in recognition of mounting behaviour.
