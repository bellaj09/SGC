Sparse representation based classification SRC nuclear-norm matrix regression NMR and deep learning DL have achieved a great success in face recognition FR. However there still exist some intrinsic limitations among them. SRC and NMR based coding methods belong to one-step model such that the latent discriminative information of the coding error vector cannot be fully exploited. DL as a multi-step model can learn powerful representation but relies on large-scale data and computation resources for numerous parameters training with complicated back-propagation. Straightforward training of deep neural networks from scratch on small-scale data is almost infeasible. Therefore in order to develop efficient algorithms that are specifically adapted for small-scale data we propose to derive the deep models of SRC and NMR. Specifically in this paper we propose an end-to-end deep cascade model DCM based on SRC and NMR with hierarchical learning nonlinear transformation and multi-layer structure for corrupted face recognition. The contributions include four aspects. First an end-to-end deep cascade model for small-scale data without back-propagation is proposed. Second a multi-level pyramid structure is integrated for local feature representation. Third for introducing nonlinear transformation in layer-wise learning softmax vector coding of the errors with class discrimination is proposed. Fourth the existing representation methods can be easily integrated into our DCM framework. Experiments on a number of small-scale benchmark FR datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art counterparts. Additionally a perspective that deep-layered learning does not have to be convolutional neural network with back-propagation optimization is consolidated.
