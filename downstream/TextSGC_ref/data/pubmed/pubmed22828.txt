This paper presents a systematic analysis of a game controlled by a Brain-Computer Interface BCI based on Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials SSVEP. The objective is to understand BCI systems from the Human-Computer Interface HCI point of view by observing how the users interact with the game and evaluating how the interface elements influence the system performance. The interactions of 30 volunteers with our computer game named "Get Coins" through a BCI based on SSVEP have generated a database of brain signals and the corresponding responses to a questionnaire about various perceptual parameters such as visual stimulation acoustic feedback background music visual contrast and visual fatigue. Each one of the volunteers played one match using the keyboard and four matches using the BCI for comparison. In all matches using the BCI the volunteers achieved the goals of the game. Eight of them achieved a perfect score in at least one of the four matches showing the feasibility of the direct communication between the brain and the computer. Despite this successful experiment adaptations and improvements should be implemented to make this innovative technology accessible to the end user.
