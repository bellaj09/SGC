"Post-surgical pain has been consistently reported in pediatrics as being difficult to manage and limiting to surgical outcomes. Pain management of children is not ideal and some children unable to tolerate traditional pharmacological agents. Virtual reality VR is a new and promising form of non-pharmacologic analgesia. This case study explored the use of VR analgesia with a 16-year-old patient with cerebral palsy participating in a twice-daily physiotherapy program following Single Event Multi-Level Surgery. Over 6 days the patient spent half of his physiotherapy sessions using VR and the other half without order randomized. Traditional pharmacological pain management was administered throughout the trial. Using a subjective pain scale five faces denoting levels of pain the patients overall pain ratings whilst in the VR experimental condition were 41.2% less than those in the no-VR control condition. This case report provides the first evidence that VR may serve as a powerful non-pharmacologic analgesic for children following surgery."
