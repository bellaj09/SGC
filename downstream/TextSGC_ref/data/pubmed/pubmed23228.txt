"Independent component analysis ICA has been widely applied to electroencephalographic EEG biosignal processing and brain-computer interfaces. The practical use of ICA however is limited by its computational complexity data requirements for convergence and assumption of data stationarity especially for high-density data. Here we study and validate an optimized online recursive ICA algorithm ORICA with online recursive least squares RLS whitening for blind source separation of high-density EEG data which offers instantaneous incremental convergence upon presentation of new data. Empirical results of this study demonstrate the algorithms: 1 suitability for accurate and efficient source identification in high-density 64-channel realistically-simulated EEG data; 2 capability to detect and adapt to nonstationarity in 64-ch simulated EEG data; and 3 utility for rapidly extracting principal brain and artifact sources in real 61-channel EEG data recorded by a dry and wearable EEG system in a cognitive experiment. ORICA was implemented as functions in BCILAB and EEGLAB and was integrated in an open-source Real-time EEG Source-mapping Toolbox REST supporting applications in ICA-based online artifact rejection feature extraction for real-time biosignal monitoring in clinical environments and adaptable classifications in brain-computer interfaces."
