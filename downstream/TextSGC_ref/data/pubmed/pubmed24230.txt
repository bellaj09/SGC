Laparoscopic techniques are difficult to master especially for surgeons who did not receive such training during residency. To help urologists master challenging laparoscopic skills a unique 5-day mini-residency M-R program was established at the University of California Irvine. The first 101 participants in this program were evaluated on their laparoscopic skills acquisition at the end of the 5-day experience. Immediate impact of an intensive one-week laparoscopy training program on laparoscopic skills among postgraduate urologists.
