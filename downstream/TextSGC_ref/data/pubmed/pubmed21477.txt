Immersive virtual environment IVE technology offers a wide range of potential benefits to research focused on understanding how individuals perceive and respond to built and natural environments. In an effort to broaden awareness and use of IVE technology in perception preference and behavior research this review paper describes how IVE technology can be used to complement more traditional methods commonly applied in public health research. The paper also describes a relatively simple workflow for creating and displaying 360 virtual environments of built and natural settings and presents two freely-available and customizable applications that scientists from a variety of disciplines including public health can use to advance their research into human preferences perceptions and behaviors related to built and natural settings.
