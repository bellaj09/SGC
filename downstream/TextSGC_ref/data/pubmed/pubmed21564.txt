Training and simulation are gaining importance in surgical education. Today virtual reality surgery simulators provide sophisticated laparoscopic training scenarios and offer detailed assessment methods. This also makes simulators interesting for the application in surgical skills courses. The aim of the current study was to assess the suitability of a virtual surgery simulator for training and assessment in an established surgical training course. Simulation training in surgical education - application of virtual reality laparoscopic simulators in a surgical skills course.
