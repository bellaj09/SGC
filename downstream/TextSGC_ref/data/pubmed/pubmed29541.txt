"Brain-machine interfaces BMIs are a rapidly progressing technology with the potential to restore function to victims of severe paralysis via neural control of robotic systems. Great strides have been made in directly mapping a users cortical activity to control of the individual degrees of freedom of robotic end-effectors. While BMIs have yet to achieve the level of reliability desired for widespread clinical use environmental sensors e.g. RGB-D cameras for object detection and prior knowledge of common movement trajectories hold great potential for improving system performance. Here we present a novel sensor fusion paradigm for BMIs that capitalizes on information able to be extracted from the environment to greatly improve the performance of control. This was accomplished by using dynamic movement primitives to model the 3D endpoint trajectories of manipulating various objects. We then used a switching unscented Kalman filter to continuously arbitrate between the 3D endpoint kinematics predicted by the dynamic movement primitives and control derived from neural signals. We experimentally validated our system by decoding 3D endpoint trajectories executed by a non-human primate manipulating four different objects at various locations. Performance using our system showed a dramatic improvement over using neural signals alone with median distance between actual and decoded trajectories decreasing from 31.1 cm to 9.9 cm and mean correlation increasing from 0.80 to 0.98. Our results indicate that our sensor fusion framework can dramatically increase the fidelity of neural prosthetic trajectory decoding."
