"Estimation of human emotions from Electroencephalogram EEG signals plays a vital role in affective Brain Computer Interface BCI. The present study investigated the different event-related synchronization ERS and event-related desynchronization ERD of typical brain oscillations in processing Facial Expressions under nonattentional condition. The results show that the lower-frequency bands are mainly used to update Facial Expressions and distinguish the deviant stimuli from the standard ones whereas the higher-frequency bands are relevant to automatically processing different Facial Expressions. Accordingly we set up the relations between each brain oscillation and processing unattended Facial Expressions by the measures of ERD and ERS. This research first reveals the contributions of each frequency band for comprehension of Facial Expressions in preattentive stage. It also evidences that participants have emotional experience under nonattentional condition. Therefore the users emotional state under nonattentional condition can be recognized in real time by the ERD/ERS computation indexes of different frequency bands of brain oscillations which can be used in affective BCI to provide the user with more natural and friendly ways."
