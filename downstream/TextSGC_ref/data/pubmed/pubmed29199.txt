The purpose of this study was to investigate whether action observational training AOT plus brain-computer interface-based functional electrical stimulation BCI-FES has a positive influence on motor recovery of paretic upper extremity in patients with stroke. This was a hospital-based randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. Thirty patients with a first-time stroke were randomly allocated to one of two groups: the BCI-FES group n\u2009=\u200915 and the control group n\u2009=\u200915. The BCI-FES group administered to AOT plus BCI-FES on the paretic upper extremity five times per week during 4\u2009weeks while both groups received conventional therapy. The primary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity Motor Activity Log MAL Modified Barthel Index and range of motion of paretic arm. A blinded assessor evaluated the outcomes at baseline and 4\u2009weeks. All baseline outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. After 4\u2009weeks the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity sub-items total shoulder and wrist MAL MAL-Activity of Use and Quality of Movement Modified Barthel Index and wrist flexion range of motion were significantly higher in the BCI-FES group p\u2009<\u20090.05. AOT plus BCI-based FES is effective in paretic arm rehabilitation by improving the upper extremity performance. The motor improvements suggest that AOT plus BCI-based FES can be used as a therapeutic tool for stroke rehabilitation. The limitations of the study are that subjects had a certain limited level of upper arm function and the sample size was comparatively small; hence it is recommended that future large-scale trials should consider stratified and lager populations according to upper arm function.
