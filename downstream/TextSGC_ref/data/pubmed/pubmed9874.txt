"The assessment of Parkinsons disease PD using wearable sensors in non-clinical environments presents an opportunity for objective disease classification and severity prediction on a high-frequency and longitudinal basis. However many challenges exist in analysing remotely collected data due to many sources of data corruption. Using a cohort of 1815 participants 866 controls and 949 with PD we implement a range of classification algorithms on Alternate Finger Tapping test data collected on smart-phones in remote environments. We compare the disease classification ability of two traditional machine learning methods against two state-of-the-art deep learning approaches determining if the latter is successful without the definition of an explicit feature set. We find the deep learning approaches capable of disease classification often outperforming traditional methods. We show similarities between the participants successfully classified through use of a manually extracted feature set and the features learnt by a convolutional neural network. Finally we discuss the broader challenges of analysing remotely collected datasets whilst highlighting the suitability of deep learning for assessing PD when large participant numbers are available."
