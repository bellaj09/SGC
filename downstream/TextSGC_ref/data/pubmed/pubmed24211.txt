"What are the neural responses to success and failure in a throwing task? To answer this question we compared Event Related Potentials ERPs correlated with success and failure during a highly-ecological-virtual game. Participants played a tennis-like game in an immersive 3D virtual world against a computer player by controlling a virtual tennis racket with a force feedback robotic arm. Results showed that success i.e. hitting the target and failure by missing the target evoked ERPs that differ by peak latencies scalp signal distributions sLORETA source estimation and time-frequency patterns. The success related grand averaged ERP at the Cz electrode had two peaks - a negative peak at 244ms and a positive peak at 12ms prior to the actual successful hit suggesting a possible process of prediction of success. The grand averaged ERP correlated with failure at Cz had two peaks a negative peak at about 107ms and a positive peak at about 311ms post failure. These results suggest different top-down and bottom-up loops for success and failure which seem to be rooted in the spatial arrangement of the virtual game. Although the latency of the latter is consistent with the error related potentials reported in the literature the characteristic is unique to this specific error and differ significantly from other error related potentials in the same environment. These results further provide a basis for EEG based assessment and prediction of users successful or erroneous movements and design of the feedback loop in EEG based Brain-Computer Interfaces."
