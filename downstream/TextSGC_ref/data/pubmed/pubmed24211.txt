"Surgical treatments for low-rectal cancer require careful considerations due to the low location of cancer in rectums. Successful surgical outcomes highly depend on surgeons ability to determine clear distal margins of rectal tumors. This is a challenge for surgeons in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery since tumors are often concealed in rectums and robotic surgical instruments do not provide tactile feedback for tissue diagnosis in real time. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an intraoperative ultrasound-based augmented reality framework for surgical guidance in robot-assisted rectal surgery."
