"Long non-protein-coding RNAs lncRNAs identification and analysis are pervasive in transcriptome studies due to their roles in biological processes. In particular lncRNA-protein interaction has plausible relevance to gene expression regulation and in cellular processes such as pathogen resistance in plants. While lncRNA-protein interaction has been studied in animals there has yet to be extensive research in plants. In this paper we propose a novel plant lncRNA-protein interaction prediction method namely PLRPIM which combines deep learning and shallow machine learning methods. The selection of an optimal feature subset and subsequent efficient compression are significant challenges for deep learning models. The proposed method adopts k-mer and extracts high-level abstraction sequence-based features using stacked sparse autoencoder. Based on the extracted features the fusion of random forest RF and light gradient boosting machine LGBM is used to build the prediction model. The performances are evaluated on Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays datasets. Results from experiments demonstrate PLRPIMs superiority compared with other prediction tools on the two datasets. Based on 5-fold cross-validation we obtain 89.98% and 93.44% accuracy 0.954 and 0.982 AUC for Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays respectively. PLRPIM predicts potential lncRNA-protein interaction pairs effectively which can facilitate lncRNA related research including function prediction."
