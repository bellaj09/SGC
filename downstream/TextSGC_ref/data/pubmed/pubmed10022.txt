Shear-wave elastography SWE permits local estimation of tissue elasticity an important imaging marker in biomedicine. This recently-developed advanced technique assesses the speed of a laterally-travelling shear wave after an acoustic radiation force "push" to estimate local Young\s moduli in an operator-independent fashion. In this work we show how synthetic SWE sSWE images can be generated based on conventional B-mode imaging through deep learning. Using sideby-side-view B-mode/SWE images collected in 50 patients with prostate cancer we show that sSWE images with a pixel-wise mean absolute error of 4.50.96 kPa with regard to the original SWE can be generated. Visualization of high-level feature levels through t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding reveals substantial overlap between data from two different scanners. Qualitatively we examined the use of the sSWE methodology for B-mode images obtained with a scanner without SWE functionality. We also examined the use of this type of network in elasticity imaging in the thyroid. Limitations of the technique reside in the fact that networks have to be retrained for different organs and that the method requires standardization of the imaging settings and procedure. Future research will be aimed at development of sSWE as an elasticity-related tissue typing strategy that is solely based on B-mode ultrasound acquisition and the examination of its clinical utility.
