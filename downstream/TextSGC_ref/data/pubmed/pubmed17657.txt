The Animatronics Workshop is a learning experience in which kids conceive and construct a robotic show. They write the story build the robotic mechanisms and the set perform voice acting and create the motion tracks. This provides a deep cross-disciplinary experience teaching participants how to think creatively across traditional areas of expertise. In an intensive three-day prototype workshop in summer 2013 14 high school students created a three-character show. Animatronics Workshop: a theater + engineering collaboration at a high school.
