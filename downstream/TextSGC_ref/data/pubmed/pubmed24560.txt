Error-related potentials ErrP are generated in the brain when humans perceive errors. These ErrP signals can be used to classify actions as erroneous or non-erroneous using single-trial electroencephalography EEG. A small number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ErrP detection as feedback for reinforcement-learning-based brain-computer interfaces BCI confirming the possibility of developing more autonomous BCI. These systems could be made more efficient with specific information about the type of error that occurred. A few studies differentiated the ErrP of different errors from each other based on direction or severity. However errors cannot always be categorised in these ways. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of differentiating very similar error conditions from each other in the absence of previously explored metrics.
