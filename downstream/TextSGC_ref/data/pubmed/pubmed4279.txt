Our recent study has demonstrated that increased connectivity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical CTC circuitry is a state-independent neural trait that can potentially predict the onset of psychosis. One possible cause of such "trait" abnormality would be genetic predisposition. Here we tested this hypothesis using multi-paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data from two independent twin cohorts. In a sample of 85 monozygotic MZ and 52 dizygotic DZ healthy twin pairs acquired from the Human Connectome Project we showed that the connectivity pattern of the identified CTC circuitry was more similar in the MZ twins r\u2009=\u20090.54 compared with that in the DZ twins r\u2009=\u20090.22. The structural equation modeling analysis revealed a heritability estimate of 0.52 for the CTC connectivity suggesting a moderately strong genetic effect. Moreover using an independent schizophrenia cotwin sample 10 discordant MZ cotwins 30 discordant DZ cotwins and 32 control cotwins we observed a significant linear relationship between genetic distance to schizophrenia and the connectivity strength in the CTC circuitry i.e. schizophrenia MZ cotwins\u2009>\u2009schizophrenia DZ cotwins\u2009>\u2009control twins P\u2009=\u20090.045. The present data provide converging evidence that increased connectivity in the CTC circuitry is likely to be a heritable trait that is associated with the genetic risk of schizophrenia. Evidence for cerebello-thalamo-cortical hyperconnectivity as a heritable trait for schizophrenia.
