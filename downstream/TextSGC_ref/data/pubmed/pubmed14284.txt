"Urgent pump conversion during off-pump coronary artery bypass OPCAB results in high morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively evaluated if the peri-operative integrated strategy prevents this lethal event in our 400 consecutive OPCAB operations. The patients with preoperative cardiogenic shock and/or ventricular arrhythmias underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting CABG. All other patients 99% of total CABG were scheduled to undergo OPCAB n=400. Prophylactic intraaortic balloon pumping IABP was applied to the patients with critical >95% left main trunk stenosis or low <0.35 left ventricular ejection fraction. All the patients received the deep pericardial suture apex-traction device suction-type stabilizer test-clamp of target coronary arteries by micro bulldog clamp and intra-coronary shunts. Intra-operative IABP was applied in the case of sustained ST-segment change and/or elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Pump conversion was indicated for the patients with ventricular fibrillation and/or cardiogenic shock. Two patients 0.5% had pump conversion due to ventricular arrhythmia and sustained hypotension respectively. These pump conversion did not result in hospital mortality. Three hospital deaths 0.7% occurred due to non-cardiac causes. The integrated strategy using prophylactic or intra-operative IABP in OPCAB produce a low pump conversion rate even during an early period of surgeons learning curve."
