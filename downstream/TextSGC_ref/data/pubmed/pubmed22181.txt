Animal as well as human research indicated that the ventral medial prefrontal cortex vmPFC is highly relevant for fear extinction learning. Recently we showed that targeting the vmPFC with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS in a placebo-controlled study with 45 healthy controls induced higher prefrontal activity during extinction of conditioned stimuli CS+ in the active compared to the sham stimulated group and better extinction learning as indicated by ratings fear potentiated startles and skin conductance responses. Medial prefrontal cortex stimulation accelerates therapy response of exposure therapy in acrophobia.
