"Monitoring pilots mental states is a relevant approach to mitigate human error and enhance human machine interaction. A promising brain imaging technique to perform such a continuous measure of human mental state under ecological settings is Functional Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy fNIRS. However to our knowledge no study has yet assessed the potential of fNIRS connectivity metrics as long as passive Brain Computer Interfaces BCI are concerned. Therefore we designed an experimental scenario in a realistic simulator in which 12 pilots had to perform landings under two contrasted levels of engagement manual vs. automated. The collected data were used to benchmark the performance of classical oxygenation features i.e. Average Peak Variance Skewness Kurtosis Area Under the Curve and Slope and connectivity features i.e. Covariance Pearsons and Spearmans Correlation Spectral Coherence and Wavelet Coherence to discriminate these two landing conditions. Classification performance was obtained by using a shrinkage Linear Discriminant Analysis sLDA and a stratified cross validation using each feature alone or by combining them. Our findings disclosed that the connectivity features performed significantly better than the classical concentration metrics with a higher accuracy for the wavelet coherence average: 65.3/59.9 % min: 45.3/45.0 max: 80.5/74.7 computed for HbO/HbR signals respectively. A maximum classification performance was obtained by combining the area under the curve with the wavelet coherence average: 66.9/61.6 % min: 57.3/44.8 max: 80.0/81.3 computed for HbO/HbR signals respectively. In a general manner all connectivity measures allowed an efficient classification when computed over HbO signals. Those promising results provide methodological cues for further implementation of fNIRS-based passive BCIs."
