With the developments of DNA sequencing technology large amounts of sequencing data have been produced that provides unprecedented opportunities for advanced association studies between somatic mutations and cancer types/subtypes which further contributes to more accurate somatic mutation based cancer typing SMCT. In existing SMCT methods however the absence of high-level feature extraction is a major obstacle in improving the classification performance. Cancer type prediction based on copy number aberration and chromatin 3D structure with convolutional neural networks.
