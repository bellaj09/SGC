The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale NIHSS awards higher deficit scores for infarcts in the dominant hemisphere when compared with otherwise similar infarcts in the nondominant hemisphere. This has been shown to adversely affect stroke recognition therapeutic decisions and outcome. However factors modifying the association between infarct side and deficit severity are incompletely understood. Thus we sought to determine whether age and age-related leukoaraiosis alter the relation between NIHSS deficit score and the side and volume of infarction. Impact of Leukoaraiosis Burden on Hemispheric Lateralization of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Deficit in Acute Ischemic Stroke.
