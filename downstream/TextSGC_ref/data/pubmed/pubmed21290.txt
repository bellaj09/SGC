The linear discriminant analysis LDA method is a classical and commonly utilized technique for dimensionality reduction and classification in brain-computer interface BCI systems. Being a first-order discriminator LDA is usually preceded by the feature extraction of electroencephalogram EEG signals as multi-density EEG data are of second order. In this study an analytic bilinear classification method which inherits and extends LDA is proposed. This method considers 2-dimentional EEG signals as the feature input and performs classification using the optimized complex-valued bilinear projections. Without being transformed into frequency domain the complex-valued bilinear projections essentially spatially and temporally modulate the phases and magnitudes of slow event-related potentials ERPs elicited by distinct brain states in the sense that they become more separable. The results show that the proposed method has demonstrated its discriminating capability in the development of a rapid image triage RIT system which is a challenging variant of BCIs due to the fast presentation speed and consequently overlapping of ERPs.
