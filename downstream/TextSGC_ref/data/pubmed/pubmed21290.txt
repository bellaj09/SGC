Despite the increased interest about tele-rehabilitation virtual reality and outcome measures for stroke rehabilitation surprisingly little research has been done to map and summarize the most common outcome measures used in tele-rehabilitation. For this review we propose to conduct a systematic search of the literature that reports outcome measures used in tele-rehabilitation or virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation. Specific objectives include: 1 to identify the outcome measures used in tele-rehabilitation studies; 2 to describe the psychometric properties of the outcome measures in the included studies; 3 to describe which parts of the International Classification of Functioning are measured in the studies.
