Deep learning methods for image quality assessment IQA are limited due to the small size of existing datasets. Extensive datasets require substantial resources both for generating publishable content and annotating it accurately. We present a systematic and scalable approach to creating KonIQ-10k the largest IQA dataset to date consisting of 10073 quality scored images. It is the first in-the-wild database aiming for ecological validity concerning the authenticity of distortions the diversity of content and quality-related indicators. Through the use of crowdsourcing we obtained 1.2 million reliable quality ratings from 1459 crowd workers paving the way for more general IQA models. We propose a novel deep learning model KonCept512 to show an excellent generalization beyond the test set 0.921 SROCC to the current state-of-the-art database LIVE-in-the-Wild 0.825 SROCC. The model derives its core performance from the InceptionResNet architecture being trained at a higher resolution than previous models 512  384. Correlation analysis shows that KonCept512 performs similar to having 9 subjective scores for each test image.
