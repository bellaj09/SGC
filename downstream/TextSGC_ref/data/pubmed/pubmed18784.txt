The human quest to master the anatomy and physiology of living systems started as early as 1600 BC with documents from the Greeks Indians and Romans presenting the earliest systematic studies and advances. Following the fall of the Roman Empire the progress slowed until the Renaissance renewed scientific interest in anatomy and physiology ushering in an era of spectacular advances. Alongside the discoveries of modern science innovations in media such as printing photography and color reproduction improved the accuracy of communicating science. Techniques for noninvasively viewing the human body such as magnetic resonance imaging opened up new ways of exploring and understanding anatomy physiology and disease pathogenesis. Advances in three-dimensional 3D-technologies including computer graphics and animation are directly linked to many advances in medicine and surgery. Anatomy education has come a long way from papyrus leaf inscriptions to computerized 3D modeling holographic representation and virtual reality-based software. The future presents unlimited options for studying and understanding anatomy as Google glasses bioprinting virtual reality and allied technologies transform the world into a classroom. This review summarizes the journey of mankind to master anatomy and physiology. From papyrus leaves to bioprinting and virtual reality: history and innovation in anatomy.
