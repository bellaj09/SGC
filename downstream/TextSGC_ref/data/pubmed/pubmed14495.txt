Because a nearly constant distance between two neighbouring C atoms local backbone structure of proteins can be represented accurately by the angle between Ci-1-Ci-Ci+1  and a dihedral angle rotated about the Ci-Ci+1 bond .  and  angles as the representative of structural properties of three to four amino-acid residues offer a description of backbone conformations that is complementary to  and  angles single residue and secondary structures >3 residues. Here we report the first machine-learning technique for sequence-based prediction of  and  angles. Predicted angles based on an independent test have a mean absolute error of 9 for  and 34 for  with a distribution on the - plane close to that of native values. The average root-mean-square distance of 10-residue fragment structures constructed from predicted  and  angles is only 1.9 from their corresponding native structures. Predicted  and  angles are expected to be complementary to predicted  and  angles and secondary structures for using in model validation and template-based as well as template-free structure prediction. The deep neural network learning technique is available as an on-line server called Structural Property prediction with Integrated DEep neuRal network SPIDER at http://sparks-lab.org.
