The field of metagenomics defined as the direct genetic analysis of uncultured samples of genomes contained within an environmental sample is gaining increasing popularity. The aim of studies of metagenomics is to determine the species present in an environmental community and identify changes in the abundance of species under different conditions. Current metagenomic analysis software faces bottlenecks due to the high computational load required to analyze complex samples. Computational workflow for the fine-grained analysis of metagenomic samples.
