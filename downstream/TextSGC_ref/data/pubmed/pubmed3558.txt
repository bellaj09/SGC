Correlated fluctuations of single neuron discharges on a mesoscopic scale decrease as a function of lateral distance in early sensory cortices reflecting a rapid spatial decay of lateral connection probability and excitation. However spatial periodicities in horizontal connectivity and associational input as well as an enhanced probability of lateral excitatory connections in the association cortex could theoretically result in nonmonotonic correlation structures. Here we show such a spatially nonmonotonic correlation structure characterized by significantly positive long-range correlations in the inferior convexity of the macaque prefrontal cortex. This functional connectivity kernel was more pronounced during wakefulness than anesthesia and could be largely attributed to the spatial pattern of correlated variability between functionally similar neurons during structured visual stimulation. These results suggest that the spatial decay of lateral functional connectivity is not a common organizational principle of neocortical microcircuits. A nonmonotonic correlation structure could reflect a critical topological feature of prefrontal microcircuits facilitating their role in integrative processes.
