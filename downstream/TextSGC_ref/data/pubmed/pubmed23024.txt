To improve training in histology and pathology an integrative case-based histopathology laboratory exercise that used virtual microscopy was offered to first-year medical students during the KCOM gastrointestinal block. Students showed improvement in their understanding of histology and pathology after completing the exercise. Most students agreed that the combined histopathology laboratory helped them improve their understanding of histology and pathology in the gastrointestinal system and link normal histological and pathological changes to better understand disease processes.
