"Artificial intelligence AI is gaining extensive attention for its excellent performance in image-recognition tasks and increasingly applied in breast ultrasound. AI can conduct a quantitative assessment by recognizing imaging information automatically and make more accurate and reproductive imaging diagnosis. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women severely threatening womens health the early screening of which is closely related to the prognosis of patients. Therefore utilization of AI in breast cancer screening and detection is of great significance which can not only save time for radiologists but also make up for experience and skill deficiency on some beginners. This article illustrates the basic technical knowledge regarding AI in breast ultrasound including early machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms and their application in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant masses. At last we talk about the future perspectives of AI in breast ultrasound." Artificial intelligence in breast ultrasound.
