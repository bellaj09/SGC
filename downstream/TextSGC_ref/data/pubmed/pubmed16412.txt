This study assessed the convergent validity of a virtual environment VE navigation learning task the Groton Maze Learning Test GMLT and selected traditional neuropsychological tests performed in a group of healthy elderly adults n = 24. The cohort was divided equally between males and females to explore performance variability due to sex differences which were subsequently characterized and reported as part of the analysis. To facilitate performance comparisons specific "efficiency" scores were created for both the VE navigation task and the GMLT. Men reached peak performance more rapidly than women during VE navigation and on the GMLT and significantly outperformed women on the first learning trial in the VE. Results suggest reasonable convergent validity across the VE task GMLT and selected neuropsychological tests for assessment of spatial memory. Convergent validity and sex differences in healthy elderly adults for performance on 3D virtual reality navigation learning and 2D hidden maze tasks.
