A brain-computer interface BCI is a technique for controlling devices with the measured human brain activities. Especially an asynchronous BCI is one of the most important topics since practical input interfaces are incomplete without self-paced inputs. In order to construct an asynchronous BCI it is essential to recognize the standby state where a user enters no commands. In this paper we propose a novel method for detecting the standby state and develop an asynchronous BCI based on event-related potentials with the intended movement direction.We conducted online experiments with developed asynchronous BCI. As a result all three subjects showed considerable recognition accuracies. Asynchronous brain-computer interfacing based on intended movement direction.
