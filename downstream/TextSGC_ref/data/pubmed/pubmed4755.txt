A key question in modern neuroscience is how cognitive changes in a human brain can be quantified and captured by functional connectivity FC. A systematic approach to measure pairwise functional distance at different brain states is lacking. This would provide a straightforward way to quantify differences in cognitive processing across tasks; also it would help in relating these differences in task-based FCs to the underlying structural network. Here we propose a framework based on the concept of Jensen-Shannon divergence to map the task-rest connectivity distance between tasks and resting-state FC. We show how this information theoretical measure allows for quantifying connectivity changes in distributed and centralized processing in functional networks. We study resting state and seven tasks from the Human Connectome Project dataset to obtain the most distant links across tasks. We investigate how these changes are associated with different functional brain networks and use the proposed measure to infer changes in the information-processing regimes. Furthermore we show how the FC distance from resting state is shaped by structural connectivity and to what extent this relationship depends on the task. This framework provides a well-grounded mathematical quantification of connectivity changes associated with cognitive processing in large-scale brain networks.
