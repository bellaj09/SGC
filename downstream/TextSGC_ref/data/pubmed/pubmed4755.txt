The brain is a very complex structure. Over the past several decades many studies have aimed to understand how various non-uniform variables relate to each other. The current study compared the whole-brain network organization and global spatial distribution of cell densities in the monkey brain. Wide comparisons between 27 graph theoretical measures and cell densities revealed that only participation coefficients PCs significantly correlated with cell densities. Interestingly PCs did not show a significant correlation with spatial coordinates. Furthermore the significance of the correlation between cell densities and spatial coordinates disappeared only with the removal of the visual module while the significance of the correlation between cell densities and PCs disappeared with the removal of any one module. Taken together these results suggested the presence of a combinatorial effect of modular architectures in the network organization related to the non-uniformity of cell densities additional to the spatially monotonic change.
