Post-amputation phantom limb pain PLP is a widespread phenomenon that can have physical psychological and functional impacts on amputees who experience the condition. The varying presentations and mechanisms of PLP make it difficult to effectively provide long-term pain relief. Multiple neuromodulatory approaches to treating PLP have focused on electrical stimulation of the peripheral nervous system with varying degrees of success. More recently research has been done to study the effects of neuroprosthetic approaches on PLP. Neuroprosthetics combine the use of a functional prosthetic with stimulation to the peripheral nerves in the residual limb. Although many of the neuroprosthetic studies focus on improving function several have shown preliminary evidence for the reduction of severity of PLP. In this review we provide an overview of the current understanding of the neurological mechanisms that initiate and sustain PLP as well as the neuromodulatory and neuroprosthetic approaches under development for treatment of the condition.
