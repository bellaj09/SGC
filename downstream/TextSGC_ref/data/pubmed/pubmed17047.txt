Intrinsic excitability IE can be defined as an output of action potentials from a given input signal. Changes to the IE of a neuron are an important aspect of the cellular plasticity that underlies learning and memory process. In this study long-term plastic change in IE of deep dorsal horn neurons DHNs was investigated. Associative spike pairing stimulation PS induced a long-lasting increase in IE. Buffering intracellular calcium with BAPTA 10mM prevented the induction of a long-lasting increase in IE. PS failed to induce a long-lasting increase in IE in the presence of either D-APV 50 microM or cadmium chloride 100 microM. Apamin 100 nM partially blocked the induction of a long-lasting increase in IE. This intrinsic plasticity requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ and NMDA receptor activation during the induction period and this process might be mediated by the down-regulation of small-conductance calcium-dependent potassium SK channels. In deep DHNs PS induced excitatory postsynaptic potential EPSP-spike E-S potentiation which increases the firing probability and the number of spikes by consistent dorsal rootlet stimulation. Under bath application of bicuculline 10 microM and strychnine 1 microM PS induced E-S potentiation and long-lasting increases in IE. These results suggest that an increase in IE might underlie E-S potentiation while a reduction in inhibitory transmission does not contribute to E-S potentiation and long-lasting increases in IE. We conclude that PS enhances the IE of deep DHNs which may play an important role in spinal processing of nociceptive information.
