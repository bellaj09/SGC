This paper presents the domain of information sciences applied informatics and biomedical engineering proposing to develop methods for an automated detection of similarities between two particular virtual learning environments - virtual patients at Akutne.cz and the OPTIMED curriculum management system - in order to provide support to clinically oriented stages of medical and healthcare studies. For this purpose the authors used large amounts of text-based data collected by the system for mapping medical curricula and through the system for virtual patient authoring and delivery. The proposed text-mining algorithm for an automated detection of links between content entities of these systems has been successfully implemented by the means of a web-based toolbox. Similarity Detection Between Virtual Patients and Medical Curriculum Using R.
