Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder in which patients experience an abnormal sense of self. While deficits in sensorimotor self-representation agency are well documented in schizophrenia less is known about other aspects of bodily self-representation body ownership. Here we tested a large cohort N = 59 of chronic schizophrenia patients and matched controls N = 30 on a well-established body illusion paradigm the Full Body Illusion FBI. In this paradigm changes in body ownership are induced through prolonged multisensory stimulation in which participants are stroked on their back while seeing the stroking on the back of a virtual body. When the felt and seen stroking are synchronous participants typically feel higher identification with the seen body as well as a drift in self-location towards it. However when the stroking is asynchronous no such changes occur. Our results show no evidence for abnormal body ownership in schizophrenia patients. A meta-analysis of previous work corroborates this result. Thus while schizophrenia patients may be impaired in the sense of agency their multisensory bodily self-representation as tested here seems to be unaffected by the illness. Rethinking Body Ownership in Schizophrenia: Experimental and Meta-analytical Approaches Show no Evidence for Deficits.
