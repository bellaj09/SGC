Biclustering has become a major tool for analyzing large datasets given as matrix of samples times features and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems respectively. actor nalysis for cluster cquisition FABIA one of the most successful biclustering methods is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated and sample membership is difficult to determine. We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks RFNs to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse non-linear high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.
