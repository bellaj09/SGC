Deep learning techniques e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs have been explosively applied to the research in the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing. However few research efforts have addressed semantic indexing with deep learning. The use of semantic indexing in the biomedical literature has been limited for several reasons. For instance MEDLINE citations contain a large number of semantic labels from automatically annotated MeSH terms and for a great deal of the literature only the information of the title and the abstract is readily available. In this paper we propose a Boltzmann Convolutional neural network framework B-CNN for biomedicine semantic indexing. In our hybrid learning framework the CNN can adaptively deal with features of documents that have sequence relationships and can capture context information accordingly; the Deep Boltzmann Machine DBM merges global the entity in each document and local information through its training with undirected connections. Additionally we have designed a hierarchical coarse to fine style indexing structure for learning and classifying documents and a novel feature extension approach with word sequence embedding and Wikipedia categorization. Comparative experiments were conducted for semantic indexing of biomedical abstract documents; these experiments verified the encouraged performance of our B-CNN model.
