"The pistons of sparse aperture systems need to be controlled within a fraction of a wavelength for the systems optimal imaging performance. In this paper we demonstrate that deep learning is capable of performing piston sensing with a single wide-band image after appropriate training. Taking the sensing issue as a fitting task the deep learning-based method utilizes a deep convolutional neural network to learn complex input-output mapping relations between the broadband intensity distributions and corresponding piston values. Given a trained network and one broadband focal intensity image as the input the piston can be obtained directly and the capture range achieving the coherence length of the broadband light is available. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. Using only in-focused broadband images as the inputs without defocus division and wavelength dispersion obviously relaxes the optics complexity. In view of the efficiency and superiority its expected that the method proposed in this paper may be widely applied in multi-aperture imaging."
