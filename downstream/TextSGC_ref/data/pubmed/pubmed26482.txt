Effective feature extraction and classification methods are of great importance for motor imagery MI-based brain-computer interface BCI systems. The common spatial pattern CSP algorithm is a widely used feature extraction method for MI-based BCIs. In this work we propose a novel spatial-frequency-temporal optimized feature sparse representation-based classification method. Optimal channels are selected based on relative entropy criteria. Significant CSP features on frequency-temporal domains are selected automatically to generate a column vector for sparse representation-based classification SRC. We analyzed the performance of the new method on two public EEG datasets namely BCI competition III dataset IVa which has five subjects and BCI competition IV dataset IIb which has nine subjects. Compared to the performance offered by the existing SRC method the proposed method achieves average classification accuracy improvements of 21.568 and 14.38% for BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset IIb respectively. Furthermore our approach also shows better classification performance when compared to other competing methods for both datasets.
