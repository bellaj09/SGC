For laparoscopic surgery various training systems have been developed to teach handling of an endoscope as well as the manipulation of instruments for speedy and precise endoscopic performance using both hands. In endoscopic endonasal surgery EES especially using a binostril approach to the skull base and intradural lesions the learning of more meticulous manipulation of instruments is mandatory and it may be necessary to develop another type of training method for acquiring psychomotor skills for EES. Authors of the present study developed an inexpensive portable personal trainer using a webcam and objectively evaluated its utility.
