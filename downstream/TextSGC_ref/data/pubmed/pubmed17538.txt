"AutoTutor is a learning environment that tutors students by holding a conversation in natural language. AutoTutor has been developed for Newtonian qualitative physics and computer literacy. Its design was inspired by explanation-based constructivist theories of learning intelligent tutoring systems that adaptively respond to student knowledge and empirical research on dialogue patterns in tutorial discourse. AutoTutor presents challenging problems formulated as questions from a curriculum script and then engages in mixed initiative dialogue that guides the student in building an answer. It provides the student with positive neutral or negative feedback on the students typed responses pumps the student for more information prompts the student to fill in missing words gives hints fills in missing information with assertions identifies and corrects erroneous ideas answers the students questions and summarizes answers. AutoTutor has produced learning gains of approximately .70 sigma for deep levels of comprehension." AutoTutor: a tutor with dialogue in natural language.
