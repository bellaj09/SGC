Animals continuously gather sensory cues to move towards favourable environments. Efficient goal-directed navigation requires sensory perception and motor commands to be intertwined in a feedback loop yet the neural substrate underlying this sensorimotor task in the vertebrate brain remains elusive. Here we combine virtual-reality behavioural assays volumetric calcium imaging optogenetic stimulation and circuit modelling to reveal the neural mechanisms through which a zebrafish performs phototaxis i.e. actively orients towards a light source. Key to this process is a self-oscillating hindbrain population HBO that acts as a pacemaker for ocular saccades and controls the orientation of successive swim-bouts. It further integrates visual stimuli in a state-dependent manner i.e. its response to visual inputs varies with the motor context a mechanism that manifests itself in the phase-locked entrainment of the HBO by periodic stimuli. A rate model is developed that reproduces our observations and demonstrates how this sensorimotor processing eventually biases the animal trajectory towards bright regions.Active locomotion requires closed-loop sensorimotor co ordination between perception and action. Here the authors show using behavioural imaging and modelling approaches that gaze orientation during phototaxis behaviour in larval zebrafish is related to oscillatory dynamics of a neuronal population in the hindbrain.
