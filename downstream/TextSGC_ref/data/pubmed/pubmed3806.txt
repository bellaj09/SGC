Macroscopic structural networks in the human brain have a rich-club architecture comprising both highly inter-connected central regions and sparsely connected peripheral regions. Recent studies show that disruption of this functionally efficient organisation is associated with several psychiatric disorders. However despite increasing attention to this network property whether age-associated changes in rich-club organisation occur during human adolescence remains unclear. Here analysing a publicly shared diffusion tensor imaging dataset we found that during adolescence brains of typically developing TD individuals showed increases in rich-club organisation and inferred network functionality whereas individuals with autism spectrum disorders ASD did not. These differences between TD and ASD groups were statistically significant for both structural and functional properties. Moreover this typical age-related changes in rich-club organisation were characterised by progressive involvement of the right anterior insula. In contrast in ASD individuals did not show typical increases in grey matter volume and this relative anatomical immaturity was correlated with the severity of ASD social symptoms. These results provide evidence that rich-club architecture is one of the bases of functionally efficient brain networks underpinning complex cognitive functions in adult human brains. Furthermore our findings suggest that immature rich-club organisation might be associated with some neurodevelopmental disorders.
