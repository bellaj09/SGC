The central nervous system of the Ciona larva contains only 177 neurons. The precise regulation of neuron subtype-specific morphogenesis and differentiation observed during the formation of this minimal connectome offers a unique opportunity to dissect gene regulatory networks underlying chordate neurodevelopment. Here we compare the transcriptomes of two very distinct neuron types in the hindbrain/spinal cord homolog of Ciona the Motor Ganglion MG: the Descending decussating neuron ddN proposed homolog of Mauthner Cells in vertebrates and the MG Interneuron 2 MGIN2. Both types are invariantly represented by a single bilaterally symmetric left/right pair of cells in every larva. Supernumerary ddNs and MGIN2s were generated in synchronized embryos and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed ddN- and MGIN2-specific enrichment of a wide range of genes including many encoding potential "effectors" of subtype-specific morphological and functional traits. More specifically we identified the upregulation of centrosome-associated microtubule-stabilizing/bundling proteins and extracellular guidance cues part of a single intrinsic regulatory program that might underlie the unique polarization of the ddNs the only descending MG neurons that cross the midline. Consistent with our predictions CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tissue-specific elimination of two such candidate effectors Efcab6-related and Netrin1 impaired ddN polarized axon outgrowth across the midline.
