In this study an electroencephalogram EEG analysis system combined with feature selection is proposed to enhance the classification of motor imagery MI data. It principally comprises feature extraction feature selection and classification. First several features including adaptive autoregressive AAR parameters spectral power asymmetry ratio coherence and phase-locking value are extracted for subsequent classification. A genetic algorithm is then used to select features from the combination of the aforementioned features. Finally the selected features are classified by support vector machine SVM. Compared with "without feature selection" and back-propagation neural network BPNN on MI data from 2 data sets the proposed system achieves better classification accuracy and is suitable for the applications of brain-computer interface BCI. Improving classification accuracy of motor imagery EEG using genetic feature selection.
