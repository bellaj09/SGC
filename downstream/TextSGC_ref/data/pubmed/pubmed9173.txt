Scutellarin is the major and active constituent of Dengzhan Xixin Injection DZXX a traditional Chinese medicine prepared from the aqueous extract of Erigeron breviscapus and widely used for the treatment of various cerebrovascular diseases in clinic. In present study the possible pharmacokinetic differences of scutellarin after intravenous administration of scutellarin alone or DZXX were explored. Additional the potential roles of -glucuronidase GLU and OATP2B1 in drug-drug interaction DDI between scutellarin and constituents of DZXX were further evaluated in vitro. The plasma concentration urinary and biliary excretion of scutellarin in rats after administration of DZXX were significantly higher than those received scutellarin while pharmacokinetic profile of Apigenin 7-O-glucuronide AG in rats was similar no matter AG or DZXX group. Furthermore higher concentration in brain and plasma however lower level of scutellarin in intestine were observed after intravenous administration of DZXX. Finally AG and caffeoylquinic acid esters were found to significantly inhibit GLU and OATP2B1 in vitro which might explain at least in part the pharmacokinetic DDI between scutellarin and other chemical constituents in DZXX. The findings provided deep insight into the prescription-formulating principle in DZXX for treating the cerebrovascular diseases. -Glucuronidase- and OATP2B1-mediated drug interaction of scutellarin in Dengzhan Xixin Injection: A formulation aspect.
