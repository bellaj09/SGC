Neural interfaces hold great promise to become invaluable clinical and diagnostic tools in the near future. However the biocompatibility and the long-term stability of the implanted interfaces are far from optimized. There are several factors that need to be addressed and standardized when improving the long-term success of an implanted electrode. We have chosen to focus on three key factors when evaluating the evoked tissue responses after electrode implantation into the brain: implant size fixation mode and evaluation period. Further we show results from an ultrathin multichannel wire electrode that has been implanted in the rat cerebral cortex for 1 year. To improve biocompatibility of implanted electrodes we would like to suggest that free-floating very small flexible and in time wireless electrodes would elicit a diminished cell encapsulation. We would also like to suggest standardized methods for the electrode design the electrode implantation method and the analyses of cell reactions after implantation into the CNS in order to improve the long-term success of implanted neural interfaces. Can histology solve the riddle of the nonfunctioning electrode? Factors influencing the biocompatibility of brain machine interfaces.
