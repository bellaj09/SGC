Schizotypy is a psychological construct related to schizophrenia. The exact relationship between both entities is not clear. In recent years schizophrenia has been associated with hippocampal abnormalities and spatial memory problems. The aim of this study was to determine possible links between high schizotypy HS and low schizotypy LS and spatial abilities using virtual reality tasks. We hypothesised that the HS group would exhibit a lower performance in spatial memory tasks than the LS group. High and low schizotypal female subjects do not differ in spatial memory abilities in a virtual reality task.
