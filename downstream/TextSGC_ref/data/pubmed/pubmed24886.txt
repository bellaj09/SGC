Clinical and experimental evidence advocates a structural and functional link between the vestibular and other sensory systems. For instance visuo-vestibular and vestibular-somatosensory interactions have been widely reported. However whether visual inputs carrying vestibular information can modulate pain is not yet clear. Recent evidence using natural vestibular stimulation or moving visual stimuli points at an unspecific effect of distraction.
