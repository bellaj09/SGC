"Water sensitive urban design is being promoted in many countries. In Singapore the Active Beautiful Clean ABC Waters Programme is a long-term strategic initiative of PUB Singapores National Water Agency to improve the quality of water and urban liveability. While there are some estimates of the bio-physical and ecological benefits of the ABC Waters Programme information on its social or non-market values is lacking. Using choice experiment datasets this study explores whether people express preferences for ABC Waters features. It also examines whether there is any difference in preferences between respondents living in developments with and without ABC Waters certification and between respondents living in public and private housing. It is found that respondents living in private housing have substantially higher willingness to pay for ABC Waters features compared to the respondents in public housing. The differences between respondents from certified and non-certified projects were found to be mixed. Such information would be useful to tailor the design of the ABC Waters program. Finally the potential impact of using a virtual reality tool to present information in a choice experiment towards peoples preferences is explored. Application of a virtual reality tool has reduced the proportion of protest voters and increased peoples willingness to pay for ABC Waters projects. Thus this paper contributes to the growing literature on the implications of providing information visually in non-market valuation surveys." "Non-market value of Singapores ABC Waters Program."
