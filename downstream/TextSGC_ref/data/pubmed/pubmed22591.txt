This research studies the process of 3D reconstruction and dynamic concision based on 2D medical digital images using virtual reality modelling language VRML and JavaScript language with a focus on how to realize the dynamic concision of 3D medical model with script node and sensor node in VRML. The 3D reconstruction and concision of body internal organs can be built with such high quality that they are better than those obtained from the traditional methods. With the function of dynamic concision the VRML browser can offer better windows for man-computer interaction in real-time environment than ever before. 3D reconstruction and dynamic concision with VRML can be used to meet the requirement for the medical observation of 3D reconstruction and have a promising prospect in the fields of medical imaging. Dynamic concision for three-dimensional reconstruction of human organ built with virtual reality modelling language VRML.
