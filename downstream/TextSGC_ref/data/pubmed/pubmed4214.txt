The wiring of vertebrate and invertebrate brains provides the anatomical skeleton for cognition and behavior. Connections among brain regions are characterized by heterogeneous strength that is parsimoniously described by the wiring cost and homophily principles. Moreover brains exhibit a characteristic global network topology including modules and hubs. However the mechanisms resulting in the observed interregional wiring principles and network topology of brains are unknown. Here with the aid of computational modeling we demonstrate that a mechanism based on heterochronous and spatially ordered neurodevelopmental gradients without the involvement of activity-dependent plasticity or axonal guidance cues can reconstruct a large part of the wiring principles on average 83% and global network topology on average 80% of diverse adult brain connectomes including fly and human connectomes. In sum space and time are key components of a parsimonious plausible neurodevelopmental mechanism of brain wiring with a potential universal scope encompassing vertebrate and invertebrate brains.
