Good chemical selectivity of sensors for detecting vapour traces of targeted molecules is vital to reliable detection systems for explosives and other harmful materials. We present the design construction and measurements of the electronic response of a 16 channel electronic nose based on 16 differential microcapacitors which were surface-functionalized by different silanes. The e-nose detects less than 1 molecule of TNT out of 10+12 N molecules in a carrier gas in 1 s. Differently silanized sensors give different responses to different molecules. Electronic responses are presented for TNT RDX DNT HS HCN FeS NH propane methanol acetone ethanol methane toluene and water. We consider the number density of these molecules and find that silane surfaces show extreme affinity for attracting molecules of TNT DNT and RDX. The probability to bind these molecules and form a surface-adsorbate is typically 10+7 times larger than the probability to bind water molecules for example. We present a matrix of responses of differently functionalized microcapacitors and we propose that chemical selectivity of multichannel e-nose could be enhanced by using artificial intelligence deep learning methods.
