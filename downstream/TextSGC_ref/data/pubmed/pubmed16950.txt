"As a result of recent work-hours limitations and concerns for patient safety innovations in extraclinical surgical simulation have become a desired part of residency education. Current simulation models including cadaveric animal bench-top virtual reality VR and robotic simulators are increasingly used in surgical training programs. Advances in telesurgery three-dimensional 3D printing and the incorporation of patient-specific anatomy are paving the way for simulators to become integral components of medical training in the future. Evidence from the literature highlights the benefits of including simulations in surgical training; skills acquired through simulations translate into improvements in operating room performance. Moreover simulations are rapidly incorporating new medical technologies and offer increasingly high-fidelity recreations of procedures. As a result both novice and expert surgeons are able to benefit from their use. As dedicated structured curricula are developed that incorporate simulations into daily resident training simulated surgeries will strengthen the surgeons skill set decrease hospital costs and improve patient outcomes."
