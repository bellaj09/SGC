Dense connectomic mapping of neuronal circuits is limited by the time and effort required to analyze 3D electron microscopy EM datasets. Algorithms designed to automate image segmentation suffer from substantial error rates and require significant manual error correction. Any improvement in segmentation error rates would therefore directly reduce the time required to analyze 3D EM data. We explored preserving extracellular space ECS during chemical tissue fixation to improve the ability to segment neurites and to identify synaptic contacts. ECS preserved tissue is easier to segment using machine learning algorithms leading to significantly reduced error rates. In addition we observed that electrical synapses are readily identified in ECS preserved tissue. Finally we determined that antibodies penetrate deep into ECS preserved tissue with only minimal permeabilization thereby enabling correlated light microscopy LM and EM studies. We conclude that preservation of ECS benefits multiple aspects of the connectomic analysis of neural circuits. Extracellular space preservation aids the connectomic analysis of neural circuits.
