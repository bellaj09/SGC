According to the European Reference Organization for Quality Assured Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnostic Services EUREF image quality in mammography is assessed by recording and analyzing a set of images of the CDMAM phantom. The EUREF procedure applies an automated analysis combining image registration signal detection and nonlinear fitting. We present a proof of concept for an end-to-end deep learning framework that assesses image quality on the basis of single images as an alternative.
