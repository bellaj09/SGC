Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI resting-state studies show generalized social anxiety disorder gSAD is associated with disturbances in networks involved in emotion regulation emotion processing and perceptual functions suggesting a network framework is integral to elucidating the pathophysiology of gSAD. However fMRI does not measure the fast dynamic interconnections of functional networks. Therefore we examined whole-brain functional connectomics with electroencephalogram EEG during resting-state. Resting-state theta band connectivity and graph analysis in generalized social anxiety disorder.
