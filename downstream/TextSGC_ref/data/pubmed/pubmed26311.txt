"The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised CRS-R is a consistent and sensitive behavioral assessment standard for disorders of consciousness DOC patients. However the CRS-R has limitations due to its dependence on behavioral markers which has led to a high rate of misdiagnosis. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs which directly detect brain activities without any behavioral expression can be used to evaluate a patients state. In this study we explored the application of BCIs in assisting CRS-R assessments of DOC patients. Specifically an auditory passive EEG-based BCI system with an oddball paradigm was proposed to facilitate the evaluation of one item of the auditory function scale in the CRS-R - the auditory startle. The results obtained from five healthy subjects validated the efficacy of the BCI system. Nineteen DOC patients participated in the CRS-R and BCI assessments of which three patients exhibited no responses in the CRS-R assessment but were responsive to auditory startle in the BCI assessment. These results revealed that a proportion of DOC patients who have no behavioral responses in the CRS-R assessment can generate neural responses which can be detected by our BCI system. Therefore the proposed BCI may provide more sensitive results than the CRS-R and thus assist CRS-R behavioral assessments."
