Brain-computer interfaces BCIs offer tremendous promise for improving the quality of life for disabled individuals. BCIs use spike sorting to identify the source of each neural firing. To date spike sorting has been performed by either using off-chip analysis which requires a wired connection penetrating the skull to a bulky external power/processing unit or via custom application-specific integrated circuits that lack the programmability to perform different algorithms and upgrades. In this research we propose and test the feasibility of performing on-chip real-time spike sorting on a programmable smartdust including feature extraction classification compression and wireless transmission. A detailed power/performance tradeoff analysis using DVFS is presented. Our experimental results show that the execution time and power density meet the requirements to perform real-time spike sorting and wireless transmission on a single neural channel.
