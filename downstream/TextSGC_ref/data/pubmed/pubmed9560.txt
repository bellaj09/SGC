Renal cell carcinoma RCC is the most common primary renal neoplasm and is associated with the intraluminal growth into the venous system with possible extension into the inferior vena cava or even right heart. Intraoperative pulmonary embolism is a complication of resection of RCC which may be mitigated by the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass with or without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. We present a case of unexpected pulmonary embolism diagnosed during RCC surgery. The case highlights the central importance of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography use and the need for proper preoperative planning for the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.
