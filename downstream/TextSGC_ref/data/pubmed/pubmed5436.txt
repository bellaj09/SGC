"Advancement of microscopic technologies established significant progress in our understanding of the brain. In the recent effort to elucidate the complete wiring map of the brain circuitry termed connectome the different modalities of imaging technology including those of light and electron microscopy have started providing essential contribution in multiple organisms. The contribution would be impossible without the recent innovation in both acquisition and analyses of the big connectomic data. The current data demonstrated complicated networks with unidirectional and reciprocal connections of the cerebral circuits at the macroscopic and light microscopic mesoscopic levels and the unimaginable complexity of synaptic connections between axons and dendrites at the electron microscopic microscopic level. At the same time the data highlighted the necessity to make substantial advancement in methodology of the connectomic studies including efficient handling and automated analyses of the acquired dataset. Further understanding about structural and functional connectome seems to be facilitated by combinations of the different imaging modalities. Such multidisciplinary approaches will give us the clues to address whether the complete connectome can elucidate fundamental mechanisms processing the basic and higher functions of human brains."
