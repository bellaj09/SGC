"Temporal summation of pain TSP the perception of increasingly greater pain evoked by repetitive noxious stimuli is highly variable between individuals. Individuals with facilitated pain processing and/or reduced pain-modulatory capabilities are regarded as pronociceptive whereas individuals with reduced pain processing capacity are characterized as antinociceptive. Brodmann area BA 3a of the primary somatosensory cortex is part of an ascending pathway from the sensory thalamus that mediates TSP. Descending pain modulation involves projections from the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex sgACC to the periaqueductal gray to the rostral ventromedial medulla RVM. Here we tested the hypothesis that pronociceptive individuals have an enhanced TSP response compared with antinociceptive individuals marked by facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and/or reduced capacity for descending pain modulation. Eighty healthy humans were tested with a TSP protocol and underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found large interindividual differences in TSP responses which were positively correlated with functional connectivity FC between individuals right sensory thalamus with their BA 3a thal-BA 3a and with cortical thickness in their insula and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast TSP was negatively correlated with FC between individuals RVM with their sgACC RVM-sgACC. When subjects were grouped as pronociceptive or antinociceptive based on whether they had greater thal-BA 3a or RVM-sgACC FC respectively pronociceptive subjects showed greater TSP responses. Furthermore TSP was positively correlated with the extent of imbalance toward ascending nociceptive processing. Our study indicates that individuals with enhanced TSP have facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and reduced pain-modulatory capacities."
