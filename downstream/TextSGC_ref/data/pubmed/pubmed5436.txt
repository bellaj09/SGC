"Conventional brain connectivity analysis is typically based on the assessment of interregional correlations. Given that correlation coefficients are derived from both covariance and variance group differences in covariance may be obscured by differences in the variance terms. To facilitate a comprehensive assessment of connectivity we propose a unified statistical framework that interrogates the individual terms of the correlation coefficient. We have evaluated the utility of this method for metabolic connectivity analysis using 18F2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose FDG positron emission tomography PET data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI study. As an illustrative example of the utility of this approach we examined metabolic connectivity in angular gyrus and precuneus seed regions of mild cognitive impairment MCI subjects with low and high -amyloid burdens. This new multivariate method allowed us to identify alterations in the metabolic connectome which would not have been detected using classic seed-based correlation analysis. Ultimately this novel approach should be extensible to brain network analysis and broadly applicable to other imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI."
