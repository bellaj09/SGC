The traditional method of acquiring surgical skills is by apprenticeship and involves an extensive period of training with patients. Model-based and virtual reality simulation is gaining interest as alternative training allowing repetitive practice in a low-risk environment. The objective of this study was to determine if a materials model-based training format and an interactive virtual-reality simulator could provide equivalent teaching of basic ureteroscopy skills to the inexperienced medical student. Comparison of results of virtual-reality simulator and training model for basic ureteroscopy training.
