Conventional imaging modalities including ultrasonography US computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance MR play an important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD by allowing noninvasive diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. However conventional imaging modalities are limited as biomarkers of NAFLD for various reasons. Multi-parametric quantitative MRI techniques overcome many of the shortcomings of conventional imaging and allow comprehensive and objective evaluation of NAFLD. MRI can provide unconfounded biomarkers of hepatic fat iron and fibrosis in a single examination-a virtual biopsy has become a clinical reality. In this article we will review the utility and limitation of conventional US CT and MR imaging for the diagnosis NAFLD. Recent advances in imaging biomarkers of NAFLD are also discussed with an emphasis in multi-parametric quantitative MRI. Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of NAFLD.
