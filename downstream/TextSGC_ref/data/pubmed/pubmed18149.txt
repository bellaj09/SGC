"In recent years neurorehabilitation has moved from a bottom-up to a top down approach. This change has also involved the technological devices developed for motor and cognitive rehabilitation. It implies that during a task or during therapeutic exercises new top-down approaches are being used to stimulate the brain in a more direct way to elicit plasticity-mediated motor re-learning. This is opposed to Bottom up approaches which act at the physical level and attempt to bring about changes at the level of the central neural system." Rehabilitative devices for a top-down approach.
