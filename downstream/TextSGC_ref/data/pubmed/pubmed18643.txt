Virtual reality exposure therapy VRET is a promising intervention for the treatment of the anxiety disorders. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of VRET used in a behavioral or cognitive-behavioral framework with that of the classical evidence-based treatments in anxiety disorders. A comprehensive search of the literature identified 23 studies n = 608 that were included in the final analysis. The results show that in the case of anxiety disorders 1 VRET does far better than the waitlist control; 2 the post-treatment results show similar efficacy between the behavioral and the cognitive behavioral interventions incorporating a virtual reality exposure component and the classical evidence-based interventions with no virtual reality exposure component; 3 VRET has a powerful real-life impact similar to that of the classical evidence-based treatments; 4 VRET has a good stability of results over time similar to that of the classical evidence-based treatments; 5 there is a dose-response relationship for VRET; and 6 there is no difference in the dropout rate between the virtual reality exposure and the in vivo exposure. Implications are discussed. Virtual reality exposure therapy in anxiety disorders: a quantitative meta-analysis.
