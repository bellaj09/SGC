In the present study we aimed to investigate the effect of virtual reality-based bilateral upper extremity training VRBT on paretic upper limb function and muscle strength in patients with stroke. Eighteen stroke survivors were assigned to either the VRBT group n\u2009=\u200910 or the bilateral upper limb training group BT n\u2009=\u20098. Patients in the VRBT group performed bilateral upper extremity exercises in a virtual reality environment whereas those in the BT group performed conventional bilateral upper extremity exercises. All training was conducted for 30\u2009minutes\u2009day-1  3\u2009days a week for a period of 6\u2009weeks. Patients were assessed for upper extremity function and hand strength. Compared with the BT group the VRBT group exhibited significant improvements in upper extremity function and muscle strength p\u2009<\u20090.05 after the 6-week training programme. The Box and Block test results revealed that upper extremity function and elbow flexion in hand strength were significantly improved in terms of group time and interaction effect of group by time. Furthermore the VRBT group demonstrated significant improvements in upper extremity function as measured by the Jebsen Hand Function Test and Grooved Pegboard test and in the hand strength test as measured by elbow extension grip palmar pinch lateral pinch and tip pinch in both time and the interaction effect of group by time. These results suggest that VRBT is a feasible and beneficial means of improving upper extremity function and muscle strength in individuals following stroke.
