Artificial intelligence AI shows tremendous promise in the field of medical imaging with recent breakthroughs applying deep-learning models for data acquisition classification problems segmentation image synthesis and image reconstruction. With an eye towards clinical applications we summarize the active field of deep-learning-based MR image reconstruction. We review the basic concepts of how deep-learning algorithms aid in the transformation of raw k-space data to image data and specifically examine accelerated imaging and artifact suppression. Recent efforts in these areas show that deep-learning-based algorithms can match and in some cases eclipse conventional reconstruction methods in terms of image quality and computational efficiency across a host of clinical imaging applications including musculoskeletal abdominal cardiac and brain imaging. This article is an introductory overview aimed at clinical radiologists with no experience in deep-learning-based MR image reconstruction and should enable them to understand the basic concepts and current clinical applications of this rapidly growing area of research across multiple organ systems.
