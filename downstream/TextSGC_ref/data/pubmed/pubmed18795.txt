The quantification of stickiness experienced upon touching a sticky or adhesive substance has attracted intense research attention particularly for application to haptics virtual reality and human-computer interactions. Here we develop and evaluate a device that quantifies the feeling of stickiness experienced upon touching an adhesive substance. Keeping in mind that a typical pressure distribution sensor can only measure a pressing force but not a tensile force in our setup we apply an offset pressure to a pressure distribution sensor and measure the tensile force generated by an adhesive substance as the difference from the offset pressure. We propose a method of using a magnetic force to generate the offset pressure and develop a measuring device using a magnet that attracts magnetic pin arrays and pin magnets; the feasibility of the method is verified with a first prototype. We develop a second prototype that overcomes the noise problems of the first arising from the misalignment of the pins owing to the bending of the magnetic force lines at the sensor edges. We also obtain measurement results for actual samples and standard viscosity liquids. Our findings indicate the feasibility of our setup as a suitable device for measuring stickiness.
