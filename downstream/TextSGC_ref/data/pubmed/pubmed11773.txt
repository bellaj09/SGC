"Subthalamic nucleus STN deep brain stimulation DBS has recently advanced our understanding of the major role played by this basal ganglion in human emotion. Research indicates that STN DBS can induce modifications in all components of emotion and neuroimaging studies have shown that the metabolic modifications correlated with these emotional disturbances following surgery are both task- and sensory input-dependent. Nevertheless to date these modifications have not been confirmed for all emotional components notably subjective emotional experience or feelings. To identify the neural network underlying the modification of feelings following STN DBS we assessed 16 patients with Parkinsons disease before and after surgery using both subjective assessments of emotional experience and 18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 18 FDG-PET. The patients viewed six film excerpts intended to elicit happy angry fearful sad disgusted and neutral feelings and they self-rated the intensity of these feelings. After DBS there was a significant reduction in the intensity of the disgust feeling. Correlations were observed between decreased disgust experience and cerebral glucose metabolism FDG uptake in the bilateral pre-frontal cortices orbitofrontal dorsolateral and inferior frontal gyri bilateral insula and right cerebellum. We suggest that the STN contributes to the synchronization process underlying the emergence of feelings."
