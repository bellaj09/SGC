tRNAscan-SE is the leading tool for transfer RNA tRNA annotation which has been widely used in the field. However tRNAscan-SE can return a significant number of false positives when applied to large sequences. Recently conventional machine learning methods have been proposed to address this issue but their efficiency can be still limited due to their dependency on handcrafted features. With the growing availability of large-scale genomic data-sets deep learning methods especially convolutional neural networks have demonstrated excellent power in characterizing sequence patterns in genomic sequences. Thus we hypothesize that deep learning may bring further improvement for tRNA prediction. tRNA-DL: A Deep Learning Approach to Improve tRNAscan-SE Prediction Results.
