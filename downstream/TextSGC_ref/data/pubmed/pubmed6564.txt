Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is a disease characterized by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons leading to paralysis. Our previous MRI diffusion tensor imaging studies detected early white matter changes in the spinal cords of mice carrying the G93A-SOD1 mutation. Here we extend those studies using ultra-high field MRI 17.6\xa0T and fluorescent microscopy to investigate the appearance of early structural and connectivity changes in the spinal cords of ALS mice.
