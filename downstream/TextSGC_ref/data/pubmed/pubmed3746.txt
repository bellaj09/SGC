Consensus Connectome Dynamics CCD is a remarkable phenomenon of the human connectomes braingraphs that was discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at the graphical interface of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server which depicts the cerebral connections of n\u2009=\u2009418 subjects with a frequency-parameter k: For any k\u2009=\u20091 2  n one can view the graph of the edges that are present in at least k connectomes. If parameter k is decreased one-by-one from k\u2009=\u2009n through k\u2009=\u20091 then more and more edges appear in the graph since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it resembles a growing complex structure. We hypothesize that this growing structure copies the axonal development of the human brain. Here we show the robustness of the CCD phenomenon: it is almost independent of the particular choice of the set of underlying connectomes. This result shows that the CCD phenomenon is most likely a biological property of the human brain and not just a property of the data sets examined. We also present a simulation that well-describes the growth of the CCD structure: in our random graph model a doubly-preferential attachment distribution is found to mimic the CCD.
