Positron emission tomography PET represents a unique molecular tool to get in vivo access to a wide spectrum of biological and neuropathological processes of crucial relevance for neurodegenerative conditions. Although most PET findings are based on massive univariate approaches in the last decade the increasing interest in multivariate methods has paved the way to the assessment of unexplored cerebral features spanning from resting state brain networks to whole-brain connectome properties. Currently the combination of molecular neuroimaging techniques with multivariate connectivity methods represents one of the most powerful yet still emerging approach to achieve novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review we will summarize the available evidence in the field of PET molecular connectivity with the aim to provide an overview of how these studies may increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases over and above "traditional" structural/functional connectivity studies. Considering the available evidence a major focus will be represented by molecular connectivity studies using 18FFDG-PET today applied in the major neuropathological spectra from amyloidopathies and tauopathies to synucleinopathies and beyond. Pioneering studies using PET tracers targeting brain neuropathology and neurotransmission systems for connectivity studies will be discussed their strengths and limitations highlighted with reference to both applied methodology and results interpretation. The most common methods for molecular connectivity assessment will be reviewed with particular emphasis on the available strategies to investigate molecular connectivity at the single-subject level of potential relevance for not only research but also diagnostic purposes. Finally we will highlight possible future perspectives in the field with reference in particular to newly available PET tracers which will expand the application of molecular connectivity to new exciting unforeseen possibilities.
