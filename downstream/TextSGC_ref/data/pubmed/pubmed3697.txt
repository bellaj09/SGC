Restricted Boltzmann machines RBMs including greedy layer-wise trained RBMs as part of a deep belief network DBN have the ability to identify spatial patterns SPs; functional networks in resting-state fMRI rfMRI data. However there has been little research on 1 the reproducibility and test-retest reliability of SPs derived from RBMs and on 2 hierarchical SPs derived from DBNs. Test-retest reliability of spatial patterns from resting-state functional MRI using the restricted Boltzmann machine and hierarchically organized spatial patterns from the deep belief network.
