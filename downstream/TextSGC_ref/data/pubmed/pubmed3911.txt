The cingulum bundle CB is a critical white matter fiber tract in the brain which forms connections between the frontal lobe parietal lobe and temporal lobe. In non-human primates the CB is actually divided into distinct subcomponents on the basis of corticocortical connections. However at present no study has verified similar distinct subdivisions in the human brain. In this study we reconstructed these distinct subdivisions in the human brain and determined their exact cortical connections using high definition fiber tracking HDFT technique on 10 healthy adults and a 488-subject template from the Human Connectome Project HCP-488. Fiber dissections were performed to verify tractography results. Five CB segments were identified. CB-I ran from the subrostral areas to the precuneus and splenium encircling the corpus callosum CC. CB-II arched around the splenium and extended anteriorly above the CC to the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus SFG. CB-III connected the superior parietal lobule SPL and precuneus with the medial aspect of the SFG. CB-IV was a relatively minor subcomponent from the SPL and precuneus to the frontal region. CB-V the para-hippocampal cingulum stemmed from the medial temporal lobe and fanned out to the occipital lobes. Our findings not only provide a more accurate and detailed description on the associated architecture of the subcomponents within the CB but also offer new insights into the functional role of the CB in the human brain.
