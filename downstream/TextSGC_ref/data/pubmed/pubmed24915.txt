"Successful brain-computer interfaces BCIs swiftly and accurately communicate the users intention to a computer. Typically information transfer rate ITR is used to measure the performance of a BCI. We propose a multi-step process to speed up detection and classification of the users intent and maximize ITR. Users randomly looked at 4 frequency options on the interface in two sessions one without and one with performance feedback. Analysis was performed off-line. A ratio of the canonical correlation analysis CCA coefficients was used to construct a Bayesian probability model and a thresholding method for the ratio of the posterior probability of the target frequency over maximal posterior probability of non-target frequencies was used as classification criteria. Moreover the probability thresholds were optimized for each frequency subject to maximizing the ITR. We achieved a maximum ITR of 39.82 bit/min. Although the performance feedback did not improve the overall ITR it did improve the accuracy measure. Possible applications in the medical industry are discussed."
