Virtual reality VR is emerging as one of key applications in future fifth-generation 5Gnetworks. Uploading VR video in 5G network is expected to boom in near future as generalconsumers could generate high-quality VR videos with portable 360-degree cameras and arewilling to share with others. Heterogeneous networks integrating with 5G cloud-radio accessnetworks H-CRAN provides high transmission rate for VR video uploading. To address themotion characteristic of UE User Equipments and small cell feature of 5G H-CRAN in this paperwe proposed a content-sensing based resource allocation scheme for delay-sensitive VR videouploading in 5G H-CRAN in which the source coding rate of uploading VR video is determinedby the centralized RA scheduling. This scheme jointly optimizes g-NB group resource allocationRHH/g-NB association sub-channel assignment power allocation and tile encoding rate assignmentas formulated in a mixed-integer nonlinear problem MINLP. To solve the problem a three stagealgorithm is proposed. Dynamic g-NB group resource allocation is first performed according to theUE density of each group. Then joint RRH/g-NB association sub-channel allocation and powerallocation is performed by an iterative process. Finally encoding tile rate is assigned to optimizethe target objective by adopting convex optimization toolbox. The simulation results show that ourproposed algorithm ensures the total utility of system under the constraint of maximum transmissiondelay and power which also with low complexity and faster convergence.
