As an important application of functional biomaterials neural probes have contributed substantially to studying the brain. Bioinspired and biomimetic strategies have begun to be applied to the development of neural probes although these and previous generations of probes have had structural and mechanical dissimilarities from their neuron targets that lead to neuronal loss neuroinflammatory responses and measurement instabilities. Here we present a bioinspired design for neural probes-neuron-like electronics NeuE-where the key building blocks mimic the subcellular structural features and mechanical properties of neurons. Full three-dimensional mapping of implanted NeuE-brain interfaces highlights the structural indistinguishability and intimate interpenetration of NeuE and neurons. Time-dependent histology and electrophysiology studies further reveal a structurally and functionally stable interface with the neuronal and glial networks shortly following implantation thus opening opportunities for next-generation brain-machine interfaces. Finally the NeuE subcellular structural features are shown to facilitate migration of endogenous neural progenitor cells thus holding promise as an electrically active platform for transplantation-free regenerative medicine.
