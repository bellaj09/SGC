"Congestive heart failure CHF refers to the inadequate blood filling function of the ventricular pump and it may cause an insufficient heart discharge volume that fails to meet the needs of body metabolism. Heart rate variability HRV based on the RR interval is a proven effective predictor of CHF. Short-term HRV has been used widely in many healthcare applications to monitor patients health especially in combination with mobile phones and smart watches. Inspired by the inception module from GoogLeNet we combined long short-term memory LSTM and an Inception module for CHF detection. Five open-source databases were used for training and testing and three RR segment length types N = 500 1000 and 2000 were used for the comparison with other studies. With blindfold validation the proposed method achieved 99.22% 98.85% and 98.92% accuracy using the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center BIDMC CHF normal sinus rhythm NSR and the Fantasia database FD databases and 82.51% 86.68% and 87.55% accuracy using the NSR-RR and CHF-RR databases with N = 500 1000 and 2000 length RR interval segments respectively. Our end-to-end system can help clinicians to detect CHF using short-term assessment of the heartbeat. It can be installed in healthcare applications to monitor the status of human heart."
