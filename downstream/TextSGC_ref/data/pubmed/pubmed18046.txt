"Adequate velopharyngeal control is essential for speech but may be impaired in Parkinsons disease PD. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation STN DBS improves limb function in PD but the effects on velopharyngeal control remain unknown. We tested whether STN DBS would change aerodynamic measures of velopharyngeal control and whether these changes were correlated with limb function and stimulation settings."
