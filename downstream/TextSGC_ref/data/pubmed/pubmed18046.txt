"Brain-computer interfaces BCIs have enabled individuals to control devices such as spellers robotic arms drones and wheelchairs but often these BCI applications are restricted to research laboratories. With the advent of virtual reality VR systems and the internet of things IoT we can couple these technologies to offer real-time control of a users virtual and physical environment. Likewise BCI applications are often single-use with users having no control outside of the restrictions placed upon the applications at the time of creation. Therefore there is a need to create a tool that allows users the flexibility to create and modularize aspects of BCI applications for control of IoT devices and VR environments. Using a popular video game engine Unity and coupling it with BCI2000 we can create diverse applications that give the end-user additional autonomy during the task at hand. We demonstrate the validity of controlling a Unity-based VR environment and several commercial IoT devices via direct neural interfacing processed through BCI2000."
