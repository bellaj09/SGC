Enhanced surgical techniques and instrumentation enable surgeons to perform total hip arthroplasties through minimally invasive approaches. Using incisions typically less than 10 cm in length surgeons can achieve adequate visualization of the surgical site while minimizing trauma to deep soft tissues. Associated reductions in morbidity should allow for improved rehabilitation and recovery. Although these techniques have been met with some controversy a number of recent studies appear to attest to their safety and efficacy. Many of these studies have concentrated on a posterior single-incision technique for total hip arthroplasty. Favorable results for such outcomes as operative times complication rates pain functional recovery and blood loss have been reported and patient satisfaction has been high. If surgeons and their patients are to achieve maximum benefit from minimally invasive total hip arthroplasties it will be necessary to design effective educational tools that address the learning curve associated with these approaches.
