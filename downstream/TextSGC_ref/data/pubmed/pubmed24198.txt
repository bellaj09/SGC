Assistive devices for persons with limited motor control translate or amplify remaining functions to allow otherwise impossible actions. These assistive devices usually rely on just one type of input signal which can be derived from residual muscle functions or any other kind of biosignal. When only one signal is used the functionality of the assistive device can be reduced as soon as the quality of the provided signal is impaired. The quality can decrease in case of fatigue lack of concentration high noise spasms tremors depending on the type of signal. To overcome this dependency on one input signal a combination of more inputs should be feasible. This work presents a hybrid Brain-Computer Interface hBCI approach where two different input signals joystick and BCI were monitored and only one of them was chosen as a control signal at a time. Users could move a car in a game-like feedback application to collect coins and avoid obstacles via either joystick or BCI control. Both control types were constantly monitored with four different long term quality measures to evaluate the current state of the signals. As soon as the quality dropped below a certain threshold a monitoring system would switch to the other control mode and vice versa. Additionally short term quality measures were applied to check for strong artifacts that could render voluntary control impossible. These measures were used to prohibit actions carried out during times when highly uncertain signals were recorded. The switching possibility allowed more functionality for the users. Moving the car was still possible even after one control mode was not working any more. The proposed system serves as a basis that shows how BCI can be used as an assistive device especially in combination with other assistive technology.
