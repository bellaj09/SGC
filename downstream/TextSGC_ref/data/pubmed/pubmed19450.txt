This study investigated the design of a virtual reality VR simulation integrating a haptic control interface for motor skill training. Twenty-four healthy participants were tested and trained in standardized psychomotor control tasks using native and VR forms with their nondominant hands in order to identify VR design features that might serve to accelerate motor learning. The study was also intended to make preliminary observations on the degree of specific motor skill development that can be achieved with a VR-based haptic simulation. Results revealed significant improvements in test performance following training for the VR with augmented haptic features with insignificant findings for the native task and VR with basic haptic features. Although performance during training was consistently better with the native task a correspondence between the VR training and test task interfaces led to greater improvement in test performance as reported by a difference between baseline and post-test scores. These findings support use of VR-based haptic simulations of standardized psychomotor tests for motor skill training including visual and haptic enhancements for effective pattern recognition and discrete movement of objects. The results may serve as an applicable guide for design of future haptic VR features. Evaluation of an augmented virtual reality and haptic control interface for psychomotor training.
