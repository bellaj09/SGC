Recent research has shown that heartbeat-evoked potentials HEPs brain activity in response to heartbeats are a useful neural measure for investigating the functional role of brain-body interactions in cognitive processes including self-consciousness. In 2 experiments using intracranial electroencephalography EEG we investigated 1 the neural sources of HEPs 2 the underlying mechanisms for HEP generation and 3 the functional role of HEPs in bodily self-consciousness. In Experiment-1 we found that shortly after the heartbeat onset phase distributions across single trials were significantly concentrated in 10% of the recording sites mainly in the insula and the operculum but also in other regions including the amygdala and fronto-temporal cortex. Such phase concentration was not accompanied by increased spectral power and did not correlate with spectral power changes suggesting that a phase resetting rather than an additive "evoked potential" mechanism underlies HEP generation. In Experiment-2 we further aimed to anatomically refine previous scalp EEG data that linked HEPs with bodily self-consciousness. We found that HEP modulations in the insula reflected an experimentally induced altered sense of self-identification. Collectively these results provide novel and solid electrophysiological evidence on the neural sources and underlying mechanisms of HEPs and their functional role in self-consciousness.
