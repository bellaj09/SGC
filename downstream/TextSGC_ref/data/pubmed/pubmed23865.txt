"Four nerve cuff electrodes were implanted in the shoulder and arm of one subject with high tetraplegia. Stimulation produced shoulder abduction elbow flexion and extension and wrist and finger extension. Recruitment properties were quantified using twitch EMG recruitment curves and tetanic moment measurements. The chronic qualitative function of each channel of stimulation could be predicted from the intraoperative data collection. The average threshold was 11.3 +/- 9 nC and stabilized to this value over the 35 weeks of testing. The moment production of most muscles increased over the testing period due to exercise of the atrophied muscles. No muscle decreased its moment and most appeared to plateau after 15 weeks. Sensation was also evaluated since this subject had an incomplete injury and nerve stimulation was not found to painful throughout the range of muscle activation. Nerve electrodes have been shown to be a stable effective means of activating muscles for neuroprosthetics." Spiral nerve cuff electrodes for an upper extremity neuroprosthesis.
