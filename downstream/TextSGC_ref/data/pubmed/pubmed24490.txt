A precise prenatal diagnosis of hemangioma may be uncertain although a variety of the antenatal appearances on 2-dimensional sonography have been reported. A 27-year-old primigravida was referred at 32 weeks of gestation for evaluation of a fetal nuchal mass. Two-dimensional sonography showed an extracranial mixed echogenic mass 65 x 54 x 59 mm occupying the posterior neck. Color Doppler imaging revealed intense hypervascularization. Three-dimensional 3D and 4-dimensional 4D sonography showed that the mass was lobulated with a lumpy internal structure. Nuchal hemangioma was further confirmed by clinical examination and postnatal magnetic resonance imaging. The tumor began to regress in size when the infant was 7 months old. Prenatal 3D/4D ultrasound techniques could be considered as complementary diagnostic tools for such a tumor. They have the advantages of providing accurate and inexpensive virtual reality images through more realistic interactions with the virtualized in utero condition.
