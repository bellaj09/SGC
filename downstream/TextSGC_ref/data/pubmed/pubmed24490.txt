"Brain signal variation across different subjects and sessions significantly impairs the accuracy of most brain-computer interface BCI systems. Herein we present a classification algorithm that minimizes such variation using linear programming support-vector machines LP-SVM and their extension to multiple kernel learning methods. The minimization is based on the decision boundaries formed in classifiers feature spaces and their relation to BCI variation. Specifically we estimate subject/session-invariant features in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces RKHS induced with Gaussian kernels. The idea is to construct multiple subject/session-dependent RKHS and to perform classification with LP-SVMs. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm we applied it to oxy-hemoglobin data sets acquired from eight sessions and seven subjects as they performed two different mental tasks. Results show that our classifiers maintain good performance when applied to random patterns across varying sessions/subjects."
