Most people are now familiar with the concepts of big data deep learning machine learning and artificial intelligence AI and have a vague expectation that AI using medical big data can be used to improve the quality of medical care. However the expectation that big data could change the field of medicine is inconsistent with the current reality. The clinical meaningfulness of the results of research using medical big data needs to be examined. Medical staff needs to be clear about the purpose of AI that utilizes medical big data and to focus on the quality of this data rather than the quantity. Further medical professionals should understand the necessary precautions for using medical big data as well as its advantages. No doubt that someday medical big data will play an essential role in healthcare; however at present it seems too early to actively use it in clinical practice. The field continues to work toward developing medical big data and making it appropriate for healthcare. Researchers should continue to engage in empirical research to ensure that appropriate processes are in place to empirically evaluate the results of its use in healthcare.
