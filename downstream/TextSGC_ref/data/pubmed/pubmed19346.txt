"The current project is an initial attempt at validating the Virtual Reality Cognitive Performance Assessment Test VRCPAT a virtual environment-based measure of learning and memory. To examine convergent and discriminant validity a multitrait-multimethod matrix was used in which we hypothesized that the VRCPATs total learning and memory scores would correlate with other neuropsychological measures involving learning and memory but not with measures involving potential confounds i.e. executive functions; attention; processing speed; and verbal fluency. Using a sequential hierarchical strategy each stage of test development did not proceed until specified criteria were met. The 15-minute VRCPAT battery and a 1.5-hour in-person neuropsychological assessment were conducted with a sample of 30 healthy adults between the ages of 21 and 36 that included equivalent distributions of men and women from ethnically diverse populations. Results supported both convergent and discriminant validity. That is findings suggest that the VRCPAT measures a capacity that is a consistent with that assessed by traditional paper-and-pencil measures involving learning and memory and b inconsistent with that assessed by traditional paper-and-pencil measures assessing neurocognitive domains traditionally assumed to be other than learning and memory. We conclude that the VRCPAT is a valid test that provides a unique opportunity to reliably and efficiently study memory function within an ecologically valid environment."
