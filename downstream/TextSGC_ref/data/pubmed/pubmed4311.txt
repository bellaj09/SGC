Cocaine use disorder CUD is a major public health concern with devastating social economic and mental health implications. A better understanding of the underlying neurobiology and phenotypic variations in individuals with CUD is necessary for the development of effective and targeted treatments. In this study 39 women and 54 men with CUD completed a 6-min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan after intranasal oxytocin OXY or placebo administration. Graph-theory network analysis was used to quantify functional connectivity changes caused by OXY in striatum anterior cingulate cortex ACC insula and amygdala nodes of interest. OXY increased connectivity in the right ACC and left amygdala in males whereas OXY increased connectivity in the right ACC and right accumbens in females. Machine learning was then used to associate treatment response placebo minus OXY in nodes of interest with years of cocaine use and severity of childhood trauma separately for males and females. Childhood trauma and years of cocaine use were associated with OXY-induced changes in ACC connectivity for both men and women but connectivity changes in the amygdala were associated with years of cocaine use in men and connectivity changes in the right insula were associated with years of cocaine use in women. These findings suggest that salience network nodes ACC and insula are potential OXY treatment targets in CUD with the amygdala as a treatment target for men and the accumbens as a treatment target for women.
