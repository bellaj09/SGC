"Structural connectivity SC the physical pathways connecting regions in the brain and functional connectivity FC the temporal coactivations are known to be tightly linked. However the nature of this relationship is still not understood. In the present study we examined this relation more closely in six separate human neuroimaging datasets with different acquisition and preprocessing methods. We show that using simple linear associations the relation between an individuals SC and FC is not subject specific for five of the datasets. Subject specificity of SC-FC fit is achieved only for one of the six datasets the multimodal Glasser Human Connectome Project HCP parcellated dataset. We show that subject specificity of SC-FC correspondence is limited across datasets due to relatively small variability between subjects in SC compared with the larger variability in FC." Subject specificity of the correlation between large-scale structural and functional connectivity.
