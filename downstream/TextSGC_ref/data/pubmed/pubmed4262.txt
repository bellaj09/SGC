"Patients with frontal lobe gliomas often experience neurocognitive dysfunctions before surgery which affects the default mode network DMN to different degrees. This study quantitatively analyzed this effect from the perspective of cerebral hemispheric functional connectivity FC. We collected resting-state fMRI data from 20 frontal lobe glioma patients before treatment and 20 healthy controls. All of the patients and controls were right-handed. After pre-processing the images FC maps were built from the seed defined in the left or right posterior cingulate cortex PCC to the target regions determined in the left or right temporal-parietal junction TPJ respectively. The intra- and cross-group statistical calculations of FC strength were compared. The conclusions were as follows: 1 the intra-hemisphere FC strength values between the PCC and TPJ on the left and right were decreased in patients compared with controls; and 2 the correlation coefficients between the FC pairs in the patients were increased compared with the corresponding controls. When all of the patients were grouped by their tumors hemispheric location 3 the FC of the subgroups showed that the dominant hemisphere was vulnerable to glioma and 4 the FC in the dominant hemisphere showed a significant correlation with WHO grade."
