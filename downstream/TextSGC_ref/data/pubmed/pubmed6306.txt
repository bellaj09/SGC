Acupuncture has been used in the therapy of Alzheimer disease AD; however its neural mechanisms are still unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of acupuncture on the functional connectivity in AD by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI. Twenty-eight subjects 14 AD and 14 normal controls participated in this study. The rs-fMRI data were acquired before and after acupuncture stimulation at the acupoints of Tai chong Liv3 and Hegu LI4. During the baseline resting state by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ALFF we found a significantly decreased or increased ALFF in the AD patients relative to the controls. These regions were located in the right superior frontal gyrus SFG left postcentral gyrus subgenual cingulate cortex SCC right middle cingulate cortex MCC right inferior frontal gyrus IFG right hippocampus and the right inferior temporal gyrus ITG. Then we selected these brain regions as seeds to investigate whether regional activity and functional connectivity could be modulated by acupuncture in the AD patients. When compared to the pre-acupuncture stage several of the above regions showed an increased or decreased ALFF after acupuncture in the AD patients. In addition the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the precentral gyrus showed enhancement after acupuncture in the AD patients. Finally there were close correlations between the functional activity connectivity and clinical performance in the AD patients. The current study confirmed that acupuncture at Tai chong Liv3 and He gu LI4 can modulate functional activity and connectivity of specific cognition-related regions in AD patients.
