"It is well known that obesity has a multifactorial etiology including biological environmental and psychological causes. For this reason obesity treatment requires a more integrated approach than the standard behavioral treatment based on dietary and physical activity only. To test the long-term efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT of obesity including a virtual reality VR module aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the body and to modify its behavioral and emotional correlates 163 female morbidly obese inpatients body mass index >40 were randomly assigned to three conditions: a standard behavioral inpatient program SBP SBP plus standard CBT and SBP plus VR-enhanced CBT. Patients weight eating behavior and body dissatisfaction were measured at the start and upon completion of the inpatient program. Weight was assessed also at 1 year follow-up. All measures improved significantly at discharge from the inpatient program and no significant difference was found among the conditions. However odds ratios showed that patients in the VR condition had a greater probability of maintaining or improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up than SBP patients had 48% vs. 11% p\u2009=\u20090.004 and to a lesser extent than CBT patients had 48% vs. 29% p\u2009=\u20090.08. Indeed only the VR-enhanced CBT was effective in further improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up. On the contrary participants who received only the inpatient program regained back on average most of the weight they had lost. Findings support the hypothesis that a VR module addressing the locked negative memory of the body may enhance the long-term efficacy of standard CBT."
