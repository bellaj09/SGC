In the field of medical diagnosis there is a strong need to determine mechanical properties of biological tissue which are of histological and pathological relevance. Malignant tumors are significantly stiffer than surrounding healthy tissue. One of the established diagnosis procedures is the palpation of body organs and tissue. Palpation is used to measure swelling detect bone fracture find and measure pulse or to locate changes in the pathological state of tissue and organs. Current medical practice routinely uses sophisticated diagnostic tests through magnetic resonance imaging MRI computed tomography CT and ultrasound US imaging. However they cannot provide direct measure of tissue elasticity. Last year we presented the concept of the first haptic sensor actuator system to visualize and reconstruct mechanical properties of tissue using ultrasonic elastography and a haptic display with electrorheological fluids. We developed a real time strain imaging system for tumor diagnosis. It allows biopsies simultaneously to conventional ultrasound B-Mode and strain imaging investigations. We deduce the relative mechanical properties by using finite element simulations and numerical solution models solving the inverse problem. Various modifications on the haptic sensor actuator system have been investigated. This haptic system has the potential of inducing real time substantial forces using a compact lightweight mechanism which can be applied to numerous areas including intraoperative navigation telemedicine teaching and telecommunication.
