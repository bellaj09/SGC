Face cognition FC is a specific ability that cannot be fully explained by general cognitive functions. Cortical thickness CT is a neural correlate of performance and learning. In this registered report we used data from the Human Connectome Project HCP to investigate the relationship between CT in the core brain network of FC and performance on a psychometric task battery including tasks with facial content. Using structural equation modelling SEM we tested the existence of face-specific interindividual differences at behavioural and neural levels. The measurement models include general and face-specific factors of performance and CT. There was no face-specificity in CT in functionally localized areas. In post hoc analyses we compared the preregistered small regions of interest ROIs to larger non-individualized ROIs and identified a face-specific CT factor when large ROIs were considered. We show that this was probably due to low reliability of CT in the functional localization intra-class correlation coefficients ICC between 0.72 and 0.85. Furthermore general cognitive ability but not face-specific performance could be predicted by latent factors of CT with a small effect size. In conclusion for the core brain network of FC we provide exploratory evidence in need of cross-validation that areas of the cortex sharing a functional purpose did also share morphological properties as measured by CT. Are global and specific interindividual differences in cortical thickness associated with facets of cognitive abilities including face cognition?
