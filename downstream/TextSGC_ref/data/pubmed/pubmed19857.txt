Here we introduce a new virtual reality VR based simulation system for training the urological procedure of intra-detrusor botulinum toxin Botox injections into the bladder. 6 cases with different bladder anatomy and 3 subtasks are included in the curriculum; this design is guided by several expert urologists according to clinical needs and experience. These virtual bladder models can be deformed by a cystoscope model or penetrated by a needle model. Data of location and dose per injection are collected during the training. After compared among various options magnetic motion-tracking devices are chosen and integrated onto replicas of cystoscopic instruments as the VR interface for the specific operation. A web/database based learning management platform LMP is developed for online data access and validation studies of the training system. Virtual trainer for intra-detrusor injection of botulinum toxin to treat urinary incontinence.
