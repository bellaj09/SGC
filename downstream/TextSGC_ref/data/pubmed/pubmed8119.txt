There have been different efforts to predict epileptic seizures and most of them are based on the analysis of electroencephalography EEG signals; however recent publications have suggested that functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy fNIRS a relatively new technique could be used to predict seizures. The objectives of this research are to show that the application of fNIRS to epileptic seizure detection yields results that are superior to those based on EEG and to demonstrate that the application of deep learning to this problem is suitable given the nature of fNIRS recordings. A Convolutional Neural Network CNN is applied to the prediction of epileptic seizures from fNIRS signals an optical modality for recording brain waves. The implementation of the proposed method is presented in this work. Application of CNN to fNIRS recordings showed an accuracy ranging between 96.9% and 100% sensitivity between 95.24% and 100% specificity between 98.57% and 100% a positive predictive value between 98.52% and 100% and a negative predictive value between 95.39% and 100%. The most important aspect of this research is the combination of fNIRS signals with the particular CNN algorithm. The fNIRS modality has not been used in epileptic seizure prediction. A CNN is suitable for this application because fNIRS recordings are high dimensional data and they can be modeled as three-dimensional tensors for classification.
