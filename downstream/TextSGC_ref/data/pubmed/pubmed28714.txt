"Objective: Decoding neurocognitive processes on a single-trial basis with Brain-Computer Interface BCI techniques can reveal the users internal interpretation of the current situation. Such information can potentially be exploited to make devices and interfaces more user aware. In this line of research we took a further step by studying neural correlates of different levels of cognitive processes and developing a method that allows to quantify how deeply presented information is processed in the brain. Methods/Approach: Seventeen participants took part in an EEG study in which we evaluated different levels of cognitive processing no processing shallow and deep processing within three distinct domains memory language and visual imagination. Our investigations showed gradual differences in the amplitudes of event-related potentials ERPs and in the extend and duration of event-related desynchronization ERD which both correlate with task difficulty. We performed multi-modal classification to map the measured correlates of neurocognitive processing to the corresponding level of processing. Results: Successful classification of the neural components was achieved which reflects the level of cognitive processing performed by the participants. The results show performances above chance level for each participant and a mean performance of 70-90% for all conditions and classification pairs. Significance: The successful estimation of the level of cognition on a single-trial basis supports the feasibility of user-state adaptation based on ongoing neural activity. There is a variety of potential use cases such as: a user-friendly adaptive design of an interface or the development of assistance systems in safety critical workplaces."
