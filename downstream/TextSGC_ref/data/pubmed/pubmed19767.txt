Grounded in social facilitation theory this study compared the impact on exercise intensity of a virtual versus a live competitor when riding a virtual reality-enhanced stationary bike "cybercycle". It was hypothesized that competitiveness would moderate effects. Twenty-three female college students were exposed to three conditions on a cybercycle: solo training virtual competitor and live competitor. After training without a competitor solo condition for familiarization with equipment participants competed against a virtual avatar or live rider random order of presentation. A repeated-measures analysis revealed a significant condition virtual/live by competitiveness high/low interaction for exercise intensity watts. More competitive participants exhibited significantly greater exercise intensity when competing against a live versus virtual competitor. The implication is that live competitors can have an added social facilitation effect and influence exercise intensity although competitiveness moderates this effect. Virtual and live social facilitation while exergaming: competitiveness moderates exercise intensity.
