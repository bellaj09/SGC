"In December 2019 an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-Cov-2 infection occurred in Wuhan and rapidly spread to worldwide which has attracted many peoples concerns about the patients. However studies on the infection status of medical personnel is still lacking. A total of 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. From 7 January\xa0to 11 February 2020 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19. Most of them were from other clinical departments 72.2% rather than emergency department 3.7% or medical technology departments 18.5%. Among the 54 patients with COVID-19 the distribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases median age: 47 years vs\xa038 years; P\u2009=\u2009.0015. However there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups. Furthermore we observed that the lesion regions in SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs with severe-/critical-type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe 31.7% vs\xa00%; P\u2009=\u2009.028 and right lung 61% vs\xa018.2%;\xa0P\u2009=\u2009.012. Based on our findings with medical staff infection data we suggest training for all hospital staff to prevent infection and preparation of sufficient protection and disinfection materials."
