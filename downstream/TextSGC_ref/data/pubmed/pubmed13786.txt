"Xerostomia commonly occurs in patients who undergo head and neck radiation therapy and can seriously affect patients quality of life. In this study we developed a xerostomia prediction model with radiation treatment data using a 3-dimensional 3D residual convolutional neural network rCNN. The model can be used to guide radiation therapy to reduce toxicity."
