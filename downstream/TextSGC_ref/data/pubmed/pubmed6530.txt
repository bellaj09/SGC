"It has been 30 years since the mind of the worm was published in Philosophical Transactions B White et al 1986 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B314 1-340. Predicting Caenorhabditis elegans behaviour from its wiring diagram has been an enduring challenge since then. This special theme issue of Philosophical Transactions B combines research from neuroscientists physicists mathematicians and engineers to discuss advances in neural activity imaging behaviour quantification and multiscale simulations and how they are bringing the goal of whole-animal modelling at cellular resolution within reach.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution."
