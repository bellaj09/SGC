Biopsy slices are widely used in medical practice. Higher-resolution biopsy slice images reveal many details which are helpful to doctors and scientists. However it is time-consuming to take the high-resolution slice images. In this paper we propose a joint framework containing a novel transfer learning strategy and a deep super-resolution framework generating higher-resolution slice images with lower-resolution ones as input. The framework called SRFBN+ is proposed by modifying SRFBN which is a state-of-the-art framework. Specifically the structure of the feedback block of SRFBN was modified to be more flexible. Besides it is challenging to use typical transfer learning strategies directly for the tasks on slice images as the patterns on different types of biopsy slice images are varying. To this end we propose a novel transfer learning strategy called Channel Fusion Transfer Learning CF-Trans. CF-Trans builds a middle domain by mixing the data manifolds of the source domain and the target domain serving as a springboard for knowledge transferring. Thus SRFBN+ can be trained on the source domain and then the middle domain and finally the target domain. Experiments on slice images validate SRFBN+ works well in generating super-resolution slice images and CF-Trans is an efficient transfer learning strategy.
