Modeling in-vivo protein-DNA binding is not only fundamental for further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms but also a challenging task in computational biology. Deep-learning based methods have succeed in modeling in-vivo protein-DNA binding but they often 1 follow the fully supervised learning framework and overlook the weakly supervised information of genomic sequences that a bound DNA sequence may has multiple TFBSs and 2 use one-hot encoding to encode DNA sequences and ignore the dependencies among nucleotides. In this paper we propose a weakly supervised framework which combines multiple-instance learning with a hybrid deep neural network and uses k-mer encoding to transform DNA sequences for modeling in-vivo protein-DNA binding. Firstly this framework segments sequences into multiple overlapping instances using a sliding window and then encodes all instances into image-like inputs of high-order dependencies using k-mer encoding. Secondly it separately computes a score for all instances in the same bag using a hybrid deep neural network that integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Finally it integrates the predicted values of all instances as the final prediction of this bag using the Noisy-and method. The experimental results on in-vivo datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework. In addition we also explore the performance of the proposed framework when using k-mer encoding and demonstrate the performance of the Noisy-and method by comparing it with other fusion methods and find that adding recurrent layers can improve the performance of the proposed framework.
