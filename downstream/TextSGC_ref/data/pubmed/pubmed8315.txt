"We investigated the potential of deep brain stimulation DBS in the central nucleus of the amygdala CeA in rats to modulate functional reward mechanisms. The CeA is the major output of the amygdala with direct connections to the hypothalamus and gustatory brainstem and indirect connections with the nucleus accumbens. Further the CeA has been shown to be involved in learning emotional integration reward processing and regulation of feeding. We hypothesized that DBS which is used to treat movement disorders and other brain dysfunctions might block reward motivation. In rats performing a lever-pressing task to obtain sugar pellet rewards we stimulated the CeA and control structures and compared stimulation parameters. During CeA stimulation animals stopped working for rewards and rejected freely available rewards. Taste reactivity testing during DBS exposed aversive reactions to normally liked sucrose tastes and even more aversive taste reactions to normally disliked quinine tastes. Interestingly given the opportunity animals implanted in the CeA would self-stimulate with 500\xa0ms trains of stimulation at the same frequency and current parameters as continuous stimulation that would stop reward acquisition. Neural recordings during DBS showed that CeA neurons were still active and uncovered inhibitory-excitatory patterns after each stimulus pulse indicating possible entrainment of the neural firing with DBS. In summary DBS modulation of CeA may effectively usurp normal neural activity patterns to create an information lesion that not only decreased motivational wanting of food rewards but also blocked liking of rewards."
