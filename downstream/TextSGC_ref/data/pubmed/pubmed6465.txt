Spatiotemporal mapping of neural interactions through electrocorticography ECoG is the key to understanding brain functions and disorders. For the entire brain cortical areas this approach has been challenging especially in freely moving states owing to the need for extensive craniotomy. Here we introduce a flexible microelectrode array system termed iWEBS which can be inserted through a small cranial slit and stably wrap onto the curved cortical surface. Using iWEBS we measured dynamic changes of signals across major cortical domains namely somatosensory motor visual and retrosplenial areas in freely moving mice. iWEBS robustly displayed somatosensory evoked potentials SEPs in corresponding cortical areas to specific somatosensory stimuli. We also used iWEBS for mapping functional interactions between cortical areas in the propagation of spike-and-wave discharges SWDs the neurological marker of absence seizures triggered by optogenetic inhibition of a specific thalamic nucleus. This demonstrates that iWEBS represents a significant improvement over conventional ECoG recording methodologies and therefore is a competitive recording system for mapping wide-range brain connectivity under various behavioral conditions.
