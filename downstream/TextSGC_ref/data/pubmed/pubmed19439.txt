"Visualizing History: Tunnels of Vauquois is an educational immersive virtual reality exhibit that makes the invisible history of World War I soldiers experiences in the tunnels of Vauquois France visible to contemporary audiences. Using a head-mounted display a virtual environment recreated from scanned data of the original site redirected walking passive haptics aligned physical and virtual environments interactive tracked props and narration the exhibit presents the visitor with both discrete knowledge and the opportunity for emotional awareness. In this paper we describe the motivation and rationale for creating an immersive exhibit for informal learning environments such as museums libraries and school virtual reality labs. We also describe how the current exhibit functions and our iterative design process informed by observational feedback from pilot testing."
