"Commercially available virtual reality VR exercise systems are extensively used in many health domains among clinical populations. However evidence regarding the efficacy of this technology on healthy adults health-related outcomes is unknown. This pilot study compared physiological and psychological responses following exercise on a VR-based exercise bike VirZoom and traditional stationary exercise bike. Twelve healthy college students 9 females; Mage\u2009=\u200925.01 SD\u2009=\u2009 4.74; MBMI\u2009=\u200922.84 SD\u2009=\u2009 3.68 completed two separate 20-minute exercise sessions on the VR-based exercise bike and traditional stationary exercise bike. Blood pressure BP ratings of perceived exertion self-efficacy and enjoyment were assessed as primary outcomes. Dependent t-tests indicated no significant differences in mean systolic or diastolic BP changes from pre to postexercise between the VR-based exercise and traditional stationary biking sessions all p\u2009>\u20090.05. Notably participants reported significantly higher ratings of perceived exertion p\u2009<\u20090.05 Cohens d\u2009=\u20090.68 during the traditional exercise biking session compared with VR-based exercise biking session. However participants had significantly higher self-efficacy p\u2009<\u20090.05 Cohens d\u2009=\u2009-0.83 and enjoyment p\u2009<\u20090.05 Cohens d\u2009=\u2009-0.89 during the VR-based exercise biking session compared with traditional stationary biking. The commercially available VR-based exercise bike VirZoom may be considered an effective enjoyable and motivating physical activity tool. Further interventions with larger and more diverse samples and examinations of more health-related outcomes are warranted to determine optimal application of VR-based exercise programming among various populations."
