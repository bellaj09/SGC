Light fields capture both the spatial and angular rays thus enabling free-viewpoint rendering and custom selection of the focal plane. Scientists can interactively explore pre-recorded microscopic light fields of organs microbes and neurons using virtual reality headsets. However rendering high-resolution light fields at interactive frame rates requires a very high rate of texture sampling which is a challenge as the resolutions of light fields and displays continue to increase. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm to visualize 4D light fields with 3D-kernel foveated rendering 3D-KFR. 3D-KFR coupled with eye-tracking has the potential to accelerate the rendering of 4D depth-cued light fields dramatically. We have developed a perceptual model for foveated light fields by extending the KFR for the rendering of 3D meshes. On datasets of high-resolution microscopic light fields we observe 3.47-7.28 speedup in light field rendering with minimal perceptual loss of detail. We envision that 3D-KFR will reconcile the mutually conflicting goals of visual fidelity and rendering speed for interactive visualization of light fields. 3D-Kernel Foveated Rendering for Light Fields.
