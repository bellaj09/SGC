This article presents the research developed in the Laboratory of Computational Methods in Engineering of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with the Program of Distance Education of the National School of Public Health Sergio Arouca ENSP approaching the integration between Distance Education and Virtual Reality VR technology as reply to the public health educative demands that require the development of motor abilities. The application field was the formation of the professionals of the Food and Nutritional Surveillance as is the base of one of the Brazilian public policies targeting the monitoring of lacks of nutrients. The prototype consists of a complementary virtual environment supported in VR for the Monitoring of Food and Nutritional specialization course that is part of the regulate courses of the Distance Education of ENSP approaching the anthropometric procedures for being the most used in the survey of the nutritional state of the population. A total of 189 participants visited the Virtual Environment and it could be evidenced that the VR can be used as a pedagogical resource to collaborate with the processes of professional distance education that demand the development of motor abilities. The technology of virtual reality resource for formation in public health in the distance: an application for the learning of anthropometric procedures.
