The diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease sCJD can only be confirmed by abnormal protease-resistant prion protein accumulation in post-mortem brain tissue. The relationships between sCJD and cerebrospinal fluid CSF proteins such as 14-3-3 tau and -synuclein a-syn have been investigated for their potential value in pre-mortem diagnosis. Recently deep-learning DL methods have attracted attention in neurodegenerative disease research. We established DL-aided pre-mortem diagnostic methods for CJD using multiple CSF biomarkers to improve their discriminatory sensitivity and specificity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed on phospho-tau p-tau total-tau t-tau a-syn and -amyloid 1-42 and western blot analysis was performed for 14-3-3 protein from CSF samples of 49 sCJD and 256 non-CJD Korean patients respectively. The deep neural network structure comprised one input five hidden and one output layers with 20 40 30 20 and 12 hidden unit numbers per hidden layer respectively. The best performing DL model demonstrated 90.38% accuracy 83.33% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity for the three-protein combination of t-tau p-tau and a-syn and all other patients in a separate CSF set n\xa0=\xa015 with other neuronal diseases were correctly predicted to not have CJD. Thus DL-aided pre-mortem diagnosis may provide a suitable tool for discriminating CJD patients from non-CJD patients.
