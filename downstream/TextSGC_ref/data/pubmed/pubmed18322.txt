Causal knowledge is crucial for understanding and preventing suicide. Unfortunately we have little direct knowledge about suicide causes because we cannot conduct experiments that seek to make suicide more likely. In such situations translational approaches can provide valuable though tentative information. We sought to establish a new translational approach by developing a laboratory approximation of suicide with new virtual reality VR technologies. Such an approach would allow researchers to tentatively investigate the causes of suicide by conducting experiments that introduce purported causes of suicide and observe their effects on VR suicide rates. Across three studies total N\u202f=\u202f498 results indicated that our two VR suicide scenarios jumping from heights; shooting oneself were safe; rated as unpleasant realistic and suicide-relevant; associated with several relevant predictors of VR suicide completion including male sex suicidal desire suicidal capability agitation and prior suicidality; associated with reasons for not engaging in VR suicide that are similar to the reasons people give for not engaging in actual suicide; and produced 5% completion rates under neutral conditions and 25% completion rates after reward/avoid manipulations. We hope that future work further improves this approach and applies it to more directly test ideas about suicide causes and suicide prevention.
