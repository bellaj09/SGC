"Individuals with Autism are characterized by deficits in socialization and communication. In recent years several assistive technologies e.g. Virtual Reality VR have been investigated to address the socialization deficits in these individuals. Presently available VR-based systems address various aspects of social communication in an isolated manner and without monitoring ones affective state such as anxiety. However in conventional observation-based therapy a therapist adjusts the intervention paradigm by monitoring ones anxiety level. But often these individuals have an inherent inability to explicitly express their anxiety thereby inducing limitations on conventional techniques. Physiological signals being continuously available and not directly impacted by these communication difficulties can be alternatively used as markers of ones anxiety level. In our research we aim at designing a Virtual-reality bAsed Social-communication Task VAST system that can address the various aspects of social communication e.g. social context subtle social cues emotional expression etc. in a cumulative and structured way. In addition we augment this with a capability to use ones physiological signals as markers of ones anxiety level. In our preliminary feasibility study we investigate the potential of VAST to cause variations in ones performance and anxiety level that can be mapped from ones physiological indices."
