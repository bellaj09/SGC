There has been a longstanding debate about the link between callous-unemotional traits and fearlessness. However biological evidence for a relationship in adolescents is lacking. Using two adolescent samples we measured emotional reactivity and cardiac measures of sympathetic pre-ejection period and parasympathetic respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity during 3D TV and virtual reality fear induction. Study 1 included 62 community adolescents from a stratified sample. Study 2 included 60 adolescents from Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties schools. Results were consistent across both studies. Adolescents with high callous-unemotional traits showed coactivation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Consistent with these results youths with callous-unemotional traits self-reported that they felt more in control after the fear induction. Thus in both samples youth with callous-unemotional traits displayed a physiological and emotional profile suggesting they maintained control during fear induction. Therefore it is proposed here that a shift in thinking of youth with callous-unemotional traits as fearless to youth with callous-unemotional traits are better able to manage fearful situations may be more appropriate.
