During interventional procedures the deficiencies of nonstereoscopic vision increase the difficulty of identifying the anteroposterior direction and pathways of vessels. Therefore achieving real-time stereoscopic vision during interventional procedures is meaningful. Pairs of X-ray images were captured with identical parameter settings except for different rotation angles represented as the  angle. The resulting images at these  angles were used as left-eye and right-eye views and were horizontally merged into single left-right 3D images. Virtual reality VR glasses were used for achieving stereo vision. Pairs of X-ray images from four angiographies with different  angles 1.8-3.4 were merged into left-right 3D images. Observation with VR glasses can produce realistic stereo views of vascular anatomical structure. The results showed that the optimal  angles accepted by the brain for generating stereo vision were within a narrow range approximately 1.4-4.1. Subsequent tests showed that during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization 3D X-ray stereoscopic images provided significantly improved spatial discrimination and convenience for identifying the supply vessels of a liver tumor and its anteroposterior direction compared with plain X-ray images all P\u2009<\u20090.01. Real-time X-ray stereoscopic vision can be easily achieved via the straightforward method described herein and has the potential to benefit patients during interventional procedures.
