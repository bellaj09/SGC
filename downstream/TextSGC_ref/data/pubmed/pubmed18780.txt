According to the required velocity model on-line modulations of movement acceleration are performed on the basis of an optically specified difference between required and current behavior. Can this model account for observed displacement regulations in an interceptive task requiring locomotive displacements? In the present study a virtual reality set-up was coupled to a treadmill. Subjects walking on the treadmill were required to intercept a virtual ball approaching at eye-level by adjusting their velocity if necessary. While the required velocity model could partially account for displacement regulation late in the interception it was ineffective to explain early regulations. The possible use of a bearing angle strategy to control displacement regulation and the possible degree of complimentarity of these strategies are discussed. The visual control of ball interception during human locomotion.
