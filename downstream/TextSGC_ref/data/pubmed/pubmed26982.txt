"Brain-machine interfaces BMIs use brain signals to control closed-loop systems in real-time. This comes with substantial challenges such as having to remove artifacts in order to extract reliable features especially when using electroencephalography EEG. Some approaches have been described in the literature to address online artifact correction. However none are being used as a gold-standard method and no research has been conducted to analyze and compare their respective effects on statistical data analysis inference-based decision." EEG artifact correction strategies for online trial-by-trial analysis.
