With the development of motion capture and graphics technology visual feedback becomes increasingly important for tasks such as motion training. In order to engage users with immersive visual feedback we introduce smoke simulation to enhance the motion display. Boundary conditions in the smoke simulation are designed to produce smoke which follows and implies the corresponding complex human motion. We also synthesize multilayer smoke which is shown to be useful for emphasizing the motion of specified limbs. We implement our technique in an HMD-based virtual reality VR system for Tai-Chi training. User study results show that synthesized smoke is useful for enhancing the motion display and that the training process is generally preferred in terms of engagement.
