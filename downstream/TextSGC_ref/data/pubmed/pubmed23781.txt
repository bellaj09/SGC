Virtual reality VR simulators are now commercially available for various surgical skills training. The Uro Mentor VR Ureteroscopy Simulator by Symbionix is one system that may revolutionize the way we assess and teach surgical residents. Surgical educators may no longer have to depend on the operating room as the sole venue for teaching residents technical skills. We validated performance on this new system with previously developed assessment tools and compared it to performance on a high fidelity ureteroscopy bench model.
