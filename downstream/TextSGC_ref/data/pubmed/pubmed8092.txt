In multi-label text classification each textual document is assigned 1 or more labels. As an important task that has broad applications in biomedicine a number of different computational methods have been proposed. Many of these methods however have only modest accuracy or efficiency and limited success in practical use. We propose ML-Net a novel end-to-end deep learning framework for multi-label classification of biomedical texts. ML-Net: multi-label classification of biomedical texts with deep neural networks.
