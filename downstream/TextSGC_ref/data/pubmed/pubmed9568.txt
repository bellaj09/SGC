"Advancing conventional open-loop DBS as a therapy for PD is crucial for overcoming important issues such as the delicate balance between beneficial and adverse effects and limited battery longevity that are currently associated with treatment. Closed-loop or adaptive DBS aims to overcome these limitations by real-time adjustment of stimulation parameters based on continuous feedback input signals that are representative of the patients clinical state. The focus of this update is to discuss the most recent developments regarding potential input signals and possible stimulation parameter modulation for adaptive DBS in PD. Potential input signals for adaptive DBS include basal ganglia local field potentials cortical recordings electrocorticography wearable sensors and eHealth and mHealth devices. Furthermore adaptive DBS can be applied with different approaches of stimulation parameter modulation the feasibility of which can be adapted depending on specific PD phenotypes. Implementation of technological developments like machine learning show potential in the design of such approaches; however energy consumption deserves further attention. Furthermore we discuss future considerations regarding the clinical implementation of adaptive DBS in PD.  2018 The Authors.
