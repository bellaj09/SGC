To address the nonstationarity issue in EEG-based brain computer interface BCI the computational model trained using the training data needs to adapt to the data from the test sessions. In this paper we propose a novel adaptation approach based on the divergence framework. Cross-session changes can be taken into consideration by searching the discriminative subspaces for test data on the manifold of orthogonal matrices in a semi-supervised manner. Subsequently the feature space becomes more consistent across sessions and classifiers performance can be enhanced. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptation method yields improvements in classification performance.
