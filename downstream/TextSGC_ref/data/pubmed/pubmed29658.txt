Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs transfer human brain activities into computer commands and enable a communication channel without requiring movement. Among other BCI approaches steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based BCIs have the potential to become accurate assistive technologies for persons with severe disabilities. Those systems require customization of different kinds of parameters e.g. stimulation frequencies. Calibration usually requires selecting predefined parameters by experienced/trained personnel though in real-life scenarios an interface allowing people with no experience in programming to set up the BCI would be desirable. Another occurring problem regarding BCI performance is BCI illiteracy also called BCI deficiency. Many articles reported that BCI control could not be achieved by a non-negligible number of users. In order to bypass those problems we developed a SSVEP-BCI wizard a system that automatically determines user-dependent key-parameters to customize SSVEP-based BCI systems. This wizard was tested and evaluated with 61 healthy subjects. All subjects were asked to spell the phrase "RHINE WAAL UNIVERSITY" with a spelling application after key parameters were determined by the wizard. Results show that all subjects were able to control the spelling application. A mean SD accuracy of 97.14 3.73% was reached all subjects reached an accuracy above 85% and 25 subjects even reached 100% accuracy.
