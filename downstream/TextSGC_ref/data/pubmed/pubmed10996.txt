Recently significant developments have been achieved in the field of artificial intelligence in particular the introduction of deep learning technology that has improved the learning and prediction accuracy to unpresented levels especially when dealing with big data and high-resolution images. Significant developments have occurred in the area of medical signal processing measurement techniques and health monitoring such as vital biological signs for biomedical systems and noise and vibration of mechanical systems which are carried out by instruments that generate large data sets. These big data sets ultimately driven by high population growth would require Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyse and model. In this Special Issue papers are presented on the latest signal processing and deep learning techniques used for health monitoring of biomedical and mechanical systems. Special Issue "Advanced Signal Processing in Intelligent Systems for Health Monitoring".
