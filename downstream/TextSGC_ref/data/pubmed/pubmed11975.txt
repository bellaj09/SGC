"Doctors must care for many patients simultaneously and it is time-consuming to find and examine all patients medical histories. Discharge diagnoses provide hospital staff with sufficient information to enable handling multiple patients; however the excessive amount of words in the diagnostic sentences poses problems. Deep learning may be an effective solution to overcome this problem but the use of such a heavy model may also add another obstacle to systems with limited computing resources."
