The deep inferior epigastric perforator DIEP flap is normally the first choice in breast reconstruction; however due to the considerable vascular anatomical variation and the learning curve for the procedure muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous TRAM flaps are still frequently performed to reduce the rate of complications. Accurate preoperative investigation of the perforators would allow better operative preparation and possibly shorten the learning curve. In an effort to increase accuracy of preoperative planning and to aid preoperative decision-making in free abdominal flap breast reconstruction we have acquired the use of VoNavix software that creates three dimensional images from computerised tomography angiography CTA data. The use of the VoNavix software for analysis of CTA provides superior imaging that can be viewed in theatre. It together with CTA enables decisions to be made preoperatively including: which side to raise the flap; whether to aim for a medial or lateral row perforator; whether to take a segment of muscle and whether to expect an easy or difficult dissection. We have now performed over 60 free abdominal flap breast reconstructions aided with CTA and 10 of these cases also used VoNavix technology. This paper presents our initial experience with the use of this software illustrated with three patient examples. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
