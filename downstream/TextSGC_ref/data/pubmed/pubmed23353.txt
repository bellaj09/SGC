The aim of this study was to design a dynamically optimized steady-state visually evoked potential SSVEP brain-computer interface BCI system with enhanced performance relative to previous SSVEP BCIs in terms of the number of items selectable on the interface accuracy and speed. In this approach the row/column RC paradigm was employed in a SSVEP speller to increase the number of items. The target is detected by subsequently determining the row and column coordinates. To improve spelling accuracy we added a posterior processing after the canonical correlation analysis CCA approach to reduce the interfrequency variation between different subjects and named the new signal processing method CCA-RV and designed a real-time biofeedback mechanism to increase attention on the visual stimuli. To achieve reasonable online spelling speed both fixed and dynamic approaches for setting the optimal stimulus duration were implemented and compared. Experimental results for 11 subjects suggest that the CCA-RV method and the real-time biofeedback effectively increased accuracy compared with CCA and the absence of real-time feedback respectively. In addition both optimization approaches for setting stimulus duration achieved reasonable online spelling performance. However the dynamic optimization approach yielded a higher practical information transfer rate PITR than the fixed optimization approach. The average online PITR achieved by the proposed adaptive SSVEP speller including the time required for breaks between selections and error correction was 41.08 bit/min. These results indicate that our BCI speller is promising for use in SSVEP-based BCI applications. A Dynamically Optimized SSVEP Brain-Computer Interface BCI Speller.
