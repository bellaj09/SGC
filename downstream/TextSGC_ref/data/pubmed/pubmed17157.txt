Robotic-assisted kidney transplantation RAKT offers key benefits for patients that have been demonstrated in several studies. A barrier to the wider uptake of RAKT is surgical skill acquisition. This is exacerbated by the challenges of modern surgery with reduced surgical training time patient safety concerns and financial pressures. Simulation is a well-established method of developing surgical skill in a safe and controlled environment away from the patient. We have developed a 3D printed simulation model for the key step of the kidney transplant operation which is the vascular anastomosis. The model is anatomically accurate based on the CT scans of patients and it incorporates deceased donor vascular tissue. Crucially it was developed to be used in the robotic operating theatre with the operating robot to enhance its fidelity. It is portable and relatively inexpensive when compared with other forms of simulation such as virtual reality or animal lab training. It thus has the potential of being more accessible as a training tool for the safe acquisition of RAKT specific skills. We demonstrate this model here.
