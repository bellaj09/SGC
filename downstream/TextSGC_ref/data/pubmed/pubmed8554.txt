"Recent studies have shown promising results in using Deep Learning to detect malignancy in whole slide imaging however they were limited to just predicting a positive or negative finding for a specific neoplasm. We attempted to use Deep Learning with a convolutional neural network CNN algorithm to build a lymphoma diagnostic model for four diagnostic categories: 1 benign lymph node 2 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 3 Burkitt lymphoma and 4 small lymphocytic lymphoma. Our software was written in Python language. We obtained digital whole-slide images of Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slides of 128 cases including 32 cases for each diagnostic category. Four sets of 5 representative images 40x40 pixels in dimension were taken for each case. A total of 2560 images were obtained from which 1856 were used for training 464 for validation and 240 for testing. For each test set of 5 images the predicted diagnosis was combined from the prediction of five images. The test results showed excellent diagnostic accuracy at 95% for image-by-image prediction and at 100% for set-by-set prediction. This preliminary study provided a proof of concept for incorporating automated lymphoma diagnostic screen into future pathology work-flow to augment the pathologists productivity."
