Imaginary motor tasks cause brain oscillations that can be detected through the analysis of electroencephalographic EEG recordings. This article aims at studying whether or not the characteristics of the brain activity induced by the combined motor imagery MI of both hands can be assumed as the superposition of the activity generated during simple hand MIs. After analyzing the sensorimotor rhythms in EEG signals of five healthy subjects results show that the imagination of both hands movement generates in each brain hemisphere similar activity as the one produced by each simple hand MI in the contralateral side. Furthermore during simple hand MIs brain activity over the ipsilateral hemisphere presents similar characteristics as those observed during the rest condition. Thus it is shown that the proposed scheme is valid and promising for brain-computer interfaces BCI control allowing to easily detect patterns induced by combined MIs. Comparison of sensorimotor rhythms in EEG signals during simple and combined motor imageries over the contra and ipsilateral hemispheres.
