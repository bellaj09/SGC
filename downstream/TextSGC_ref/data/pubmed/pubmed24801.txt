A Brain Computer Interface BCI allows communication for impaired people unable to express their intention with common channels. Electroencephalography EEG represents an effective tool to allow the implementation of a BCI. The present paper describes a modular framework for the implementation of the graphic interface for binary BCIs based on the selection of symbols in a table. The proposed system is also designed to reduce the time required for writing text. This is made by including a motivational tool necessary to improve the quality of the collected signals and by containing a predictive module based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in a language and of words in a dictionary. The proposed framework is described in a top-down approach through its modules: signal acquisition analysis classification communication visualization and predictive engine. The framework being modular can be easily modified to personalize the graphic interface to the needs of the subject who has to use the BCI and it can be integrated with different classification strategies communication paradigms and dictionaries/languages. The implementation of a scenario and some experimental results on healthy subjects are also reported and discussed: the modules of the proposed scenario can be used as a starting point for further developments and application on severely disabled people under the guide of specialized personnel.
