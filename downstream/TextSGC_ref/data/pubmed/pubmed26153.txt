This paper presents an investigation aimed at drastically reducing the processing burden required by motor imagery brain-computer interface BCI systems based on electroencephalography EEG. In this research the focus has moved from the channel to the feature paradigm and a 96% reduction of the number of features required in the process has been achieved maintaining and even improving the classification success rate. This way it is possible to build cheaper quicker and more portable BCI systems. The data set used was provided within the framework of BCI Competition III which allows it to compare the presented results with the classification accuracy achieved in the contest. Furthermore a new three-step methodology has been developed which includes a feature discriminant character calculation stage; a score order and selection phase; and a final feature selection step. For the first stage both statistics method and fuzzy criteria are used. The fuzzy criteria are based on the S-dFasArt classification algorithm which has shown excellent performance in previous papers undertaking the BCI multiclass motor imagery problem. The score order and selection stage is used to sort the features according to their discriminant nature. Finally both order selection and Group Method Data Handling GMDH approaches are used to choose the most discriminant ones.
