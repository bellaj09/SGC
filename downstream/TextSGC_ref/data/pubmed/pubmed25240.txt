"Brain computer interfaces BCI is one of the most popular branches in biomedical engineering. It aims at constructing a communication between the disabled persons and the auxiliary equipments in order to improve the patients life. In motor imagery MI based BCI one of the popular feature extraction strategies is Common Spatial Patterns CSP. In practical BCI situation scalp EEG inevitably has the outlier and artifacts introduced by ocular head motion or the loose contact of electrodes in scalp EEG recordings. Because outlier and artifacts are usually observed with large amplitude when CSP is solved in view of L2 norm the effect of outlier and artifacts will be exaggerated due to the imposing of square to outliers which will finally influence the MI based BCI performance. While L1 norm will lower the outlier effects as proved in other application fields like EEG inverse problem face recognition etc." L1 norm based common spatial patterns decomposition for scalp EEG BCI.
