"The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the provision of mental health services. In response policymakers administrators and providers have taken bold steps toward enabling telepsychiatry to bridge this sudden gap in care for our most vulnerable populations. With rapid deregulation and adoption of this modality of care careful consideration of issues related to policy and implementation is essential to maximize its effectiveness and mitigate unintended consequences. Though the crisis places the healthcare system under strain it sets the stage for a lasting shift in not only how care is delivered but also our beliefs around the systems capacity for rapid innovative change."
