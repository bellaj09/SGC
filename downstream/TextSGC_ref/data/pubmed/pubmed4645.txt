"A major challenge in neuroscience is understanding how brain function emerges from the connectome. Most current methods have focused on quantifying functional connectomes in gray-matter GM signals obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while signals from white-matter WM have generally been excluded as noise. In this study we derived a functional connectome from WM resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent BOLD-fMRI signals from a large cohort n =\u2009488. The WM functional connectome exhibited weak small-world topology and nonrandom modularity. We also found a long-term i.e. over 10\u2009months topological reliability with topological reproducibility within different brain parcellation strategies spatial distance effect global and cerebrospinal fluid signals regression or not. Furthermore the small-worldness was positively correlated with individuals intelligence values r =\u2009.17 pcorrected =\u2009.0009. The current findings offer initial evidence using WM connectome and present additional measures by which to uncover WM functional information in both healthy individuals and in cases of clinical disease."
