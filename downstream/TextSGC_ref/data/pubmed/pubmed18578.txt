"Assessment of neurosurgical technical skills involved in the resection of cerebral tumors in operative environments is complex. Educators emphasize the need to develop and use objective and meaningful assessment tools that are reliable and valid for assessing trainees progress in acquiring surgical skills. The purpose of this study was to develop proficiency performance benchmarks for a newly proposed set of objective measures metrics of neurosurgical technical skills performance during simulated brain tumor resection using a new virtual reality simulator NeuroTouch." Proficiency performance benchmarks for removal of simulated brain tumors using a virtual reality simulator NeuroTouch.
