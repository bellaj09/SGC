The possibility of detecting movement-related cortical potentials MRCPs at the single trial level has been explored for closing the motor control loop with brain-computer interfaces BCIs for neurorehabilitation. A distinct feature of MRCPs is that the movement kinetic information is encoded in the brain potential prior to the onset of the movement which makes it possible to timely drive external devices to provide sensory feedback according to the efferent activity from the brain. The aim of this study was to compare methods for the detection different spatial filters and classification features extracted from various domains of MRCPs from continuous electroencephalography recordings from executed and imagined movements from healthy subjects n = 24 and attempted movements from stroke patients n = 6 to optimize the performance of MRCP-based BCIs for neurorehabilitation. Comparison of spatial filters and features for the detection and classification of movement-related cortical potentials in healthy individuals and stroke patients.
