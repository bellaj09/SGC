This paper presents an overview of the development of the Learning in Virtual Environments programme LIVE carried out in special education over the last four years. It is more precisely a project chronology so that the reader can sense the historical development of the programme rather than giving emphasis to any one particular feature or breakthrough which are covered in other papers and available through the authors. The project conception in a special school in Nottingham is followed by a description of the development of experiential and communicational virtual learning environments. These are followed in turn by the results of our testing programmes which show that experience gained in a virtual environment can transfer to the real world and that their use can encourage self-directed activity in students with severe learning difficulties. Also included is a discussion of the role of virtual learning environments VLEs in special education and of its attributes in the context of contemporary educational theory. Virtual environments special needs and evaluative methods.
