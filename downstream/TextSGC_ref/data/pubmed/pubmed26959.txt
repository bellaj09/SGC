"The body-weight support BWS function which helps to decrease load stresses on a user is an effective tool for gait and balance rehabilitation training for elderly people with weakened lower-extremity muscular strength hemiplegic patients etc. This study conducts structural analysis to secure user safety in order to develop a rail-type gait and balance rehabilitation training system RRTS. The RRTS comprises a rail trolley and brain-machine interface. The rail platform is connected to the ceiling structure bearing the loads of the RRTS and of the user and allowing locomobility. The trolley consists of a smart drive unit SDU that assists the user with forward and backward mobility and a body-weight support BWS unit that helps the user to control his/her body-weight load depending on the severity of his/her hemiplegia. The brain-machine interface estimates and measures on a real-time basis the body-weight load of the user and the intended direction of his/her movement. Considering the weight of the system and the user the mechanical safety performance of the system frame under an applied 250-kg static load is verified through structural analysis using ABAQUS 6.14-3 software. The maximum stresses applied on the rail and trolley under the given gravity load of 250 kg respectively are 18.52 MPa and 48.44 MPa. The respective safety factors are computed to be 7.83 and 5.26 confirming the RRTSs mechanical safety. An RRTS with verified structural safety could be utilized for gait movement and balance rehabilitation and training for patients with hemiplegia."
