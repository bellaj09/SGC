"This study explored the influence of family health history-based obesity risk feedback for their child on 147 overweight mothers guilt related to childrens lifestyle behaviors and passing down a genetic propensity for overweight. Mothers were randomized to receive or not obesity risk feedback for their 4- to 5-year-old child and then made food choices for them using a virtual reality-based buffet. Receipt of risk information increased lifestyle- and genetics-related guilt. Choosing fewer unhealthful foods for the child attenuated both types of guilt. Work in this area may aid in development of obesity risk feedback strategies that enhance child feeding." "Mothers guilt responses to childrens obesity risk feedback."
