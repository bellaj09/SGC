In the United States 13% of adults are estimated to have alcohol use disorder AUD. Most studies examining the neurobiology of AUD treat individuals with this disorder as a homogeneous group; however the theories of the neurocircuitry of AUD call for a quantitative and dimensional approach. Previous imaging studies find differences in brain structure function and resting-state connectivity in AUD but few use a multimodal approach to understand the association between severity of alcohol use and the brain differences. Resting state connectivity best predicts alcohol use severity in moderate to heavy alcohol users.
