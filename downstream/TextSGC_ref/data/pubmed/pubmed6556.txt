The various defects that occur on asphalt pavement are a direct cause car accidents and countermeasures are required because they cause significantly dangerous situations. In this paper we propose fully convolutional neural networks CNN-based road surface damage detection with semi-supervised learning. First the training DB is collected through the camera installed in the vehicle while driving on the road. Moreover the CNN model is trained in the form of a semantic segmentation using the deep convolutional autoencoder. Here we augmented the training dataset depending on brightness and finally generated a total of 40536 training images. Furthermore the CNN model is updated by using the pseudo-labeled images from the semi-supervised learning methods for improving the performance of road surface damage detection technique. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method 450 evaluation datasets were created to verify the performance of the proposed road surface damage detection and four experts evaluated each image. As a result it is confirmed that the proposed method can properly segment the road surface damages.
