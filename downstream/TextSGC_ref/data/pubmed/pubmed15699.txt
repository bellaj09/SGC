The indirect immunofluorescence IIF on HEp-2 cells is the recommended technique for the detection of antinuclear antibodies. However it is burdened by some limitations as it is time consuming and subjective and it requires trained personnel. In other fields the adoption of deep neural networks has provided an effective high-level abstraction of the raw data resulting in the ability to automatically generate optimized high-level features. A computer-aided diagnosis system for HEp-2 fluorescence intensity classification.
