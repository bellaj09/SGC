With the advent of biomedical imaging technology the number of captured and stored biomedical images is rapidly increasing day by day in hospitals imaging laboratories and biomedical institutions. Therefore more robust biomedical image analysis technology is needed to meet the requirement of the diagnosis and classification of various kinds of diseases using biomedical images. However the current biomedical image classification methods and general non-biomedical image classifiers cannot extract more compact biomedical image features or capture the tiny differences between similar images with different types of diseases from the same category. In this paper we propose a novel fused convolutional neural network to develop a more accurate and highly efficient classifier for biomedical images which combines shallow layer features and deep layer features from the proposed deep neural network architecture. In the analysis it was observed that the shallow layers provided more detailed local features which could distinguish different diseases in the same category while the deep layers could convey more high-level semantic information used to classify the diseases among the various categories. A detailed comparison of our approach with traditional classification algorithms and popular deep classifiers across several public biomedical image datasets showed the superior performance of our proposed method for biomedical image classification. In addition we also evaluated the performance of our method in modality classification of medical images using the ImageCLEFmed dataset.

In the architecture we can clearly see the feature-fusing process going from shallow layers and the deep layers. A novel fused convolutional neural network for biomedical image classification.
