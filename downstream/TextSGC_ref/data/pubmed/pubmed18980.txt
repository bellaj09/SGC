"We herein report an experimental study examining the potential positive effects of Virtual Reality VR feedback during an indoor bicycling exercise. Using a regular bike coupled to a VR system we compared conditions of no VR feedback VR feedback and VR feedback with the presence of a virtual coach acting as a pacer. In VR feedback conditions we observed a decreased level of perceived exertion and an increased level of enjoyment of physical activity when compared to a regular exercise situation no VR feedback. We also observed a shift in the subjects attentional focus from association in the absence of VR feedback to dissociation in VR feedback conditions. Moreover the presence of a virtual coach in the VR environment triggered a systematic regulation of the virtual displacement speed whose relationship with perceived enjoyment and exertion require further work."
