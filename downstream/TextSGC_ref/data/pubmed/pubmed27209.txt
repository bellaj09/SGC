We present a study in which participants were trained in several sessions to control a comparatively simple robot via an EEG-/motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface BCI. In the final experiment session pairs of participants were formed and each participant controlled one of two robots in a shared space. EEG data was recorded synchronously from both participants. We performed a joint data analysis on the datasets and found increases of phase-locking in - and -band. One such phase-locking effect appears to be time-locked to the start of the robotic action. Does machine-mediated interaction induce inter-brain synchrony?--A hyperscanning study.
