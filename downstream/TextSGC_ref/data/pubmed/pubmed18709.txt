We present NeuroSim the prototype of a training simulator for open surgical interventions on the human brain. The simulator is based on virtual reality and uses real-time simulation algorithms to interact with models generated from MRT- or CT-datasets. NeuroSim provides a native interface by using a real surgical microscope and original instruments tracked by a combination of inertial measurement units and optical tracking. Conclusively an immersive environment is generated. In a first step the navigation in an open surgery setup as well as the hand-eye coordination through a microscope can be trained. Due to its modular design further training modules and extensions can be integrated. NeuroSim has been developed in cooperation with the neurosurgical clinic of the University of Heidelberg and the VRmagic GmbH in Mannheim.
