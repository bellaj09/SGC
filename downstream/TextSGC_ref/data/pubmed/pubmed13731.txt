Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV-1 genome integration is closely related to clinical latency and viral rebound. In addition to human DNA sequences that directly interact with the integration machinery the selection of HIV integration sites has also been shown to depend on the heterogeneous genomic context around a large region which greatly hinders the prediction and mechanistic studies of HIV integration. DeepHINT: understanding HIV-1 integration via deep learning with attention.
