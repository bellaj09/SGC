We sought to determine the underlying pathophysiology relating white matter hyperintensities to chronic aphasia severity. We hypothesized that: i white matter hyperintensities are associated with damage to fibres of any length but to a higher percentage of long-range compared to mid- and short-range intracerebral white matter fibres; and ii the number of long-range fibres mediates the relationship between white matter hyperintensities and chronic post-stroke aphasia severity. We measured the severity of periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities and calculated the number and percentages of short- mid- and long-range white matter fibres in 48 individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed to assess the relationship between white matter hyperintensities connectome fibre-length measures and aphasia severity as measured with the aphasia quotient of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised WAB-AQ. We found that more severe periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities correlated with a lower proportion of long-range fibres r = -0.423 P = 0.003 and r = -0.315 P = 0.029 respectively counterbalanced by a higher proportion of short-range fibres r = 0.427 P = 0.002 and r = 0.285 P = 0.050 respectively. More severe periventricular white matter hyperintensities also correlated with a lower proportion of mid-range fibres r = -0.334 P = 0.020 while deep white matter hyperintensities did not correlate with mid-range fibres r = -0.169 P = 0.250. Mediation analyses revealed: i a significant total effect of periventricular white matter hyperintensities on WAB-AQ standardized beta = -0.348 P = 0.008; ii a non-significant direct effect of periventricular white matter hyperintensities on WAB-AQ P > 0.05; iii significant indirect effects of more severe periventricular white matter hyperintensities on worse aphasia severity mediated in parallel by fewer long-range fibres effect = -6.23 bootstrapping: standard error = 2.64 95%CI: -11.82 to -1.56 and more short-range fibres effect = 4.50 bootstrapping: standard error = 2.59 95%CI: 0.16 to 10.29. We conclude that small vessel brain disease seems to affect chronic aphasia severity through a change of the proportions of long- and short-range fibres. This observation provides insight into the pathophysiology of small vessel brain disease and its relationship with brain health and chronic aphasia severity. Long-range fibre damage in small vessel brain disease affects aphasia severity.
