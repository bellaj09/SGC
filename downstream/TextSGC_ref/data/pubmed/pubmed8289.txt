The topological landscape of gene interaction networks provides a rich source of information for inferring functional patterns of genes or proteins. However it is still a challenging task to aggregate heterogeneous biological information such as gene expression and gene interactions to achieve more accurate inference for prediction and discovery of new gene interactions. In particular how to generate a unified vector representation to integrate diverse input data is a key challenge addressed here.
