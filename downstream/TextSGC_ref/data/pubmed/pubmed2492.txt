Previous work have shown several key brain nuclei involved in acute psychological stress and glucose homeostasis. Acute stress influences glucose metabolism via released stress hormones by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. Little is known about the brain nuclei which response to peripheral glucose alteration are either abundant with glucosesensing neurons or the activations are secondary to stress. Here we profile and compare the brain nuclei that response to stress and glucose homeostasis in mouse models of acute restraint stress glucose and 2-DG injections respectively. Our present work provide a comprehensive depiction on key brain nuclei involved in CNS control of stress and glucose homeostasis which gives clue for functional identification of brain nuclei that regulate glucose homeostasis under stress. Profiling of key brain nuclei involved in CNS control of stress and glucose homeostasis.
