Peak provoked craving PPC is an alternative approach to cue-induced craving that focuses on the highest craving level experienced during the exposure to drug-related cues. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of abstinence on PPC in smokers and to determine whether PPC is altered by continuous abstinence. Results showed reductions on PPC levels only 24 hours after achieving abstinence and craving levels remain significantly lower after 7 days of abstinence. Peak provoked craving after smoking cessation.
