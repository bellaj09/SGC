Researchers have shown that immersive Virtual Reality VR can serve as an unusually powerful pain control technique. However research assessing the reported symptoms and negative effects of VR systems indicate that it is important to ascertain if these symptoms arise from the use of particular VR display devices particularly for users who are deemed "at risk" such as chronic pain patients Moreover these patients have specific and often complex needs and requirements and because basic issues such as \comfort\ may trigger anxiety or panic attacks it is important to examine basic questions of the feasibility of using VR displays. Therefore this repeated-measured experiment was conducted with two VR displays: the Oculus Rift\s head-mounted display HMD and Firsthand Technologies\ immersive desktop display DeepStream3D. The characteristics of these immersive desktop displays differ: one is worn enabling patients to move their heads while the other is peered into allowing less head movement. To assess the severity of physical discomforts 20 chronic pain patients tried both displays while watching a VR pain management demo in clinical settings. Results indicated that participants experienced higher levels of Simulator Sickness using the Oculus Rift HMD. However results also indicated other preferences of the two VR displays among patients including physical comfort levels and a sense of immersion. Few studies have been conducted that compare usability of specific VR devices specifically with chronic pain patients using a therapeutic virtual environment in pain clinics. Thus the results may help clinicians and researchers to choose the most appropriate VR displays for chronic pain patients and guide VR designers to enhance the usability of VR displays for long-term pain management interventions.
