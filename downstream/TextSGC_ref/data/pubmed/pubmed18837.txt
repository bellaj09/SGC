Augmented reality system can be applied to provide precise guidance for various kinds of manual works. The adaptability and guiding accuracy of such systems are decided by the computational model and the corresponding calibration method. In this paper a novel type of augmented reality guiding system and the corresponding designing scheme are proposed. Guided by external positioning equipment the proposed system can achieve high relative indication accuracy in a large working space. Meanwhile the proposed system is realized with a digital projector and the general back projection model is derived with geometry relationship between digitized 3D model and the projector in free space. The corresponding calibration method is also designed for the proposed system to obtain the parameters of projector. To validate the proposed back projection model the coordinate data collected by a 3D positioning equipment is used to calculate and optimize the extrinsic parameters. The final projecting indication accuracy of the system is verified with subpixel pattern projecting technique. Generic precise augmented reality guiding system and its calibration method based on 3D virtual model.
