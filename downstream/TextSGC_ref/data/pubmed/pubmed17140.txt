"For professionals in military and law enforcement domains learning to regulate ones emotions under threatening circumstances is crucial. The STRESS project envisions a virtual reality-based system to enable such professionals to train their emotion regulation skills. To explore the possibilities for such a system this article describes an experiment performed to investigate the impact of virtual training on participants experienced emotional responses in threatening situations. A set of 15 participants were asked to rate the subjective emotional intensity of a set of affective pictures at two different time points separated by 6\xa0h. The participants were divided into three groups: the first group performed a session of virtual training in between in which they received a choice-reaction task; the second group performed a session of virtual training in which they had to apply reappraisal strategies; and a control group that did not have any training session. The results indicate that the reappraisal-based training caused the participants in that group to give significantly lower ratings for the emotional intensity of the negative pictures whereas the content-based training resulted in significantly higher ratings compared to the group without training. Moreover a second experiment performed with the same participants 6\xa0months later indicated that these effects are fairly persistent over time and that they transfer to different pictures with similar characteristics."
