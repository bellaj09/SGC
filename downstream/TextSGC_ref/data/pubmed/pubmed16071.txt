Combination of two factors in rats such as the isolation during 2-4 months beginning from the 21st day of age and procedure of space cyclic learning results in a rare kind of behavioral strategy in 30% animals when the cyclic behavior is realized without food reinforcement. Such a dissociation between the vital motivation and searching behavior may be considered as an analogue of the disintegration phenomenon in neuropsychotic patients. The deep depression of learning owing to lowering of search represents the dominant type of behavioral disorders in isolants. The cyclic habit training including a 2-months pause between two sessions significantly increases behavioral search activity. The behaviors are accompanied by morphological shifts in the sensomotor cortex: significant decrease of the fifth layer giant pyramids thickness selective lowering in the satellite glia density and elimination of normal behavior-glia correlations. A special case of learning disruption as a model of a disintegration phenomenon.
