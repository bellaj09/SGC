The development of deep learning algorithms for complex tasks in digital medicine has relied on the availability of large labeled training datasets usually containing hundreds of thousands of examples. The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D deep learning model AppendiXNet to detect appendicitis one of the most common life-threatening abdominal emergencies using a small training dataset of less than 500 training CT exams. We explored whether pretraining the model on a large collection of natural videos would improve the performance of the model over training the model from scratch. AppendiXNet was pretrained on a large collection of YouTube videos called Kinetics consisting of approximately 500000 video clips and annotated for one of 600 human action classes and then fine-tuned on a small dataset of 438 CT scans annotated for appendicitis. We found that pretraining the 3D model on natural videos significantly improved the performance of the model from an AUC of 0.724 95% CI 0.625 0.823 to 0.810 95% CI 0.725 0.895. The application of deep learning to detect abnormalities on CT examinations using video pretraining could generalize effectively to other challenging cross-sectional medical imaging tasks when training data is limited.
