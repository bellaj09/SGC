SAROTUP Scanner And Reporter Of Target-Unrelated Peptides 3.1 is a significant upgrade to the widely used SAROTUP web server for the rapid identification of target-unrelated peptides TUPs in phage display data. At present SAROTUP has gathered a suite of tools for finding potential TUPs and other purposes. Besides the TUPScan the motif-based tool and three tools based on the BDB database i.e. MimoScan MimoSearch and MimoBlast three predictors based on support vector machine i.e. PhD7Faster SABinder and PSBinder are integrated into SAROTUP. The current version of SAROTUP contains 27 TUP motifs and 823 TUP sequences. We also developed the standalone SAROTUP application with graphical user interface GUI and command line versions for processing deep sequencing phage display data and distributed it as an open source package which can perform perfectly locally on almost all systems that support C++ with little or no modification. The web interfaces of SAROTUP have also been redesigned to be more self-evident and user-friendly. The latest version of SAROTUP is freely available at http://i.uestc.edu.cn/sarotup3.
