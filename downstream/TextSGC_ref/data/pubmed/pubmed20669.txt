The fine needle biopsy is an important minimally invasive procedure for providing accurate diagnosis in cases of thyroid gland nodules. This paper presents the research development and evaluation of a virtual reality simulator for the training of ultrasound guided needle biopsy of thyroid gland nodules using 3D models and haptic devices. The system is also an educative tool where the user can interact with a thyroid 3D model to feel its texture as well as rotate a complete model of the neck with transparency in order to study all its internal organs. A virtual reality simulator for training of needle biopsy of thyroid gland nodules.
