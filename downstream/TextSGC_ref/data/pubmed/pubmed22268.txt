Electroencephalography EEG-based brain computer interface BCI is the most studied noninvasive interface to build a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. However correlated noises in EEG measurements still constitute a significant challenge. Alternatively building BCIs based on filtered brain activity source signals instead of using their surface projections obtained from the noisy EEG signals is a promising and not well-explored direction. In this context finding the locations and waveforms of inner brain sources represents a crucial task for advancing source-based noninvasive BCI technologies. In this paper we propose a novel multicore beamformer particle filter multicore BPF to estimate the EEG brain source spatial locations and their corresponding waveforms. In contrast to conventional single-core beamforming spatial filters the developed multicore BPF considers explicitly temporal correlation among the estimated brain sources by suppressing activation from regions with interfering coherent sources. The hybrid multicore BPF brings together the advantages of both deterministic and Bayesian inverse problem algorithms in order to improve the estimation accuracy. It solves the brain activity localization problem without prior information about approximate areas of source locations. Moreover the multicore BPF reduces the dimensionality of the problem to half compared with the PF solution thus alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. The results based on generated and real EEG data show that the proposed framework recovers correctly the dominant sources of brain activity.
