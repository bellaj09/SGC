As for any manual procedure the learning curves for medical interventions can have undesirable phases occurring mostly in the early experience of applying a technique. There have been impressive advances in endoscopic procedures during recent years and there is an emerging trend that the number of procedures is increasing in parallel with these. In addition the introduction of screening programs for colorectal cancer will also increase the numbers of procedures needed. Recent developments in medical simulation seem promising with regard to the possibility of "training out" undesirable parts of the learning curve outside the operating room. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of the AccuTouch flexible endoscopy simulator improves the early part of the learning curve in colonoscopy training. Virtual reality colonoscopy simulation: a compulsory practice for the future colonoscopist?
