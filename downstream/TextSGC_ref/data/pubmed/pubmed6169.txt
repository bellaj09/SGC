Automated surface inspection ASI is a challenging task in industry as collecting training dataset is usually costly and related methods are highly dataset-dependent. In this paper a generic approach that requires small training data for ASI is proposed. First this approach builds classifier on the features of image patches where the features are transferred from a pretrained deep learning network. Next pixel-wise prediction is obtained by convolving the trained classifier over input image. An experiment on three public and one industrial data set is carried out. The experiment involves two tasks: 1 image classification and 2 defect segmentation. The results of proposed algorithm are compared against several best benchmarks in literature. In the classification tasks the proposed method improves accuracy by 0.66%-25.50%. In the segmentation tasks the proposed method reduces error escape rates by 6.00%-19.00% in three defect types and improves accuracies by 2.29%-9.86% in all seven defect types. In addition the proposed method achieves 0.0% error escape rate in the segmentation task of industrial data. A Generic Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Automated Surface Inspection.
