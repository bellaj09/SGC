Implantable neural prostheses are in widespread use for treating a variety of brain disorders. Until recently most implantable brain devices have been unidirectional either delivering neurostimulation without brain sensing or sensing brain activity to drive external effectors without a stimulation component. Further many neural interfaces that incorporate a sensing function have relied on hardwired connections such that subjects are tethered to external computers and cannot move freely. A new generation of neural prostheses has become available that are both bidirectional stimulate as well as record brain activity and totally implantable no externalized connections. These devices provide an opportunity for discovering the circuit basis for neuropsychiatric disorders and to prototype personalized neuromodulation therapies that selectively interrupt neural activity underlying specific signs and symptoms.
