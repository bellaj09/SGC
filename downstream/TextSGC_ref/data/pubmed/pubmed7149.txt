Cardiovascular disease CVD has become one of the most serious diseases that threaten human health. Over the past decades over 150 million humans have died of CVDs. Hence timely prediction of CVDs is especially important. Currently deep learning algorithm-based CVD diagnosis methods are extensively employed however most such algorithms can only utilize one-lead ECGs. Hence the potential information in other-lead ECGs was not utilized. To address this issue we have developed novel methods for diagnosing arrhythmia. In this work DL-CCANet and TL-CCANet are proposed to extract abstract discriminating features from dual-lead and three-lead ECGs respectively. Then the linear support vector machine specializing in high-dimensional features is used as the classifier model. On the MIT-BIH database a 95.2% overall accuracy is obtained by detecting 15 types of heartbeats using DL-CCANet. On the INCART database overall accuracies of 94.01% II and V1 leads 93.90% V1 and V5 leads and 94.07% II and V5 leads are achieved by detecting seven types of heartbeat using DL-CCANet while TL-CCANet yields a higher overall accuracy of 95.52% using the above three leads. In addition all of the above experiments are implemented using noisy ECG data. The proposed methods have potential to be applied in the clinic and mobile devices.
