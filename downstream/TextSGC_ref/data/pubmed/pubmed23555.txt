Recent research on bodily self-consciousness has assumed that it consists of three distinct components: the experience of owning a body body ownership; the experience of being a body with a given location within the environment self-location; and the experience of taking a first-person body-centered perspective on that environment perspective. Here we review recent neuroimaging studies suggesting that at least two of these components-body ownership and self-location-are implemented in rather distinct neural substrates located respectively in the premotor cortex and in the temporo-parietal junction. We examine these results and consider them in relation to clinical evidence from patients with altered body perception and work on a variety of multisensory body-related illusions such as the rubber hand illusion the full body illusion the body swap illusion and the enfacement illusion. We conclude by providing a preliminary synthesis of the data on bodily self-consciousness and its neural correlates. Bodily ownership and self-location: components of bodily self-consciousness.
