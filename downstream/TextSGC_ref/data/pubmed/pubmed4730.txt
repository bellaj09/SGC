"The relationship between structural connectivity SC and functional connectivity FC in the human brain can be studied using magnetic resonance imaging MRI. However many of the underlying physiological mechanisms and parameters cannot be directly observed with MRI. This limitation has motivated the recent use of various computational models meant to bridge the gap. However their absolute and relative explanatory power and the properties that actually drive that power remain insufficiently characterized. We performed an extensive comparison of seven mainstream computational models predicting FC from SC. We investigated the extent to which simulated FC could predict empirical FC. We also applied graph theory to the entire set of simulated and empirical FCs in order to further characterize the relationships between the models and the MRI data. The comparison was performed at three different spatial scales. We found that i there were significant effects of scale and model on predictive power; ii among all models the simplest model the simultaneous autoregressive SAR model was found to consistently perform better than the other models; iii the SAR also appeared more central from a graph theory perspective; and iv empirical FC only appeared weakly correlated with simulated FCs and was featured as peripheral in the graph analysis. We conclude that the substantial differences existing between these computational models have little impact on their predictive power for FC and that their capacity to predict FC from SC appears to be both moderate and essentially underlined by a simple core linear process embodied by the SAR model."
