In the last decades the availability of digital user-generated documents from social media has dramatically increased. This massive growth of user-generated content has also affected traditional shopping behaviour. Customers have embraced new communication channels such as microblogs and social networks that enable them not only just to talk with friends and acquaintances about their shopping experience but also to search for opinions expressed by complete strangers as part of their decision making processes. Uncovering how customers feel about specific products or brands and detecting purchase habits and preferences has traditionally been a costly and highly time-consuming task which involved the use of methods such as focus groups and surveys. However the new scenario calls for a deep assessment of current market research techniques in order to better interpret and profit from this ever-growing stream of attitudinal data. With this purpose we present a novel analysis and classification of user-generated content in terms of it belonging to one of the four stages of the Consumer Decision Journey Court et\xa0al. 2009 i.e. the purchase process from the moment when a customer is aware of the existence of the product to the moment when he or she buys experiences and talks about it. Using a corpus of short texts written in English and Spanish and extracted from different social media we identify a set of linguistic patterns for each purchase stage that will be then used in a rule-based classifier. Additionally we use machine learning algorithms to automatically identify business indicators such as the Marketing Mix elements McCarthy and Brogowicz 1981. The classification of the purchase stages achieves an average precision of 74%. The proposed classification of texts depending on the Marketing Mix elements expressed achieved an average precision of 75% for all the elements analysed. A classification of user-generated content into consumer decision journey stages.
