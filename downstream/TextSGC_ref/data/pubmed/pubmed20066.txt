"Virtual colonoscopy VC is a non-invasive screening tool for colorectal polyps which employs volume visualization of a colon model reconstructed from a CT scan of the patients abdomen. We present an immersive analytics system for VC which enhances and improves the traditional desktop VC through the use of VR technologies. Our system using a head-mounted display HMD includes all of the standard VC features such as the volume rendered endoluminal fly-through measurement tool bookmark modes electronic biopsy and slice views. The use of VR immersion stereo and wider field of view and field of regard has a positive effect on polyp search and analysis tasks in our immersive VC system a volumetric-based immersive analytics application. Navigation includes enhanced automatic speed and direction controls based on the users head orientation in conjunction with physical navigation for exploration of local proximity. In order to accommodate the resolution and frame rate requirements for HMDs new rendering techniques have been developed including mesh-assisted volume raycasting and a novel lighting paradigm. Feedback and further suggestions from expert radiologists show the promise of our system for immersive analysis for VC and encourage new avenues for exploring the use of VR in visualization systems for medical diagnosis."
