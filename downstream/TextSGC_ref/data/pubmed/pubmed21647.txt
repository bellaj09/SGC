Brain Computer Interfaces BCI usually utilize the suppression of mu-rhythm during actual or imagined motor activity. In order to create a BCI system a signal processing method is required to extract features upon which the discrimination is based. In this article the Empirical Mode Decomposition along with the Hilbert-Huang Spectrum HHS is found to contain the necessary information to be considered as an input to a discriminator. Also since the HHS defines amplitude and instantaneous frequency for each sample it can be used for an online BCI system. Experimental results when the HHS applied to EEG signals from an on-line database BCI Competition III show the potentiality of the proposed analysis to capture the imagined motor activity contributing to a more enhanced BCI performance. Hilbert-Huang Spectrum as a new field for the identification of EEG event related de-/synchronization for BCI applications.
