A robotic virtual reality simulator dV-Trainer Mimic Technologies has been accepted as an effective training tool for the da Vinci Surgical System Intuitive Surgical Inc. in previous reports. However there are no data available so far on how much time is required for an individual using the simulator to become proficient. We investigated how long and how many performances it takes to gain proficiency with the robotic virtual reality simulator through the learning curve. A study on the learning curve of the robotic virtual reality simulator.
