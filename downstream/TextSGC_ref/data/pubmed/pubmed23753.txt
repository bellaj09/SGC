"A number of studies have investigated several aspects of feasibility and validity of performance assessments with virtual reality surgical simulators. However the validity of performance assessments is limited by the reliability of such measurements and some issues of reliability still need to be addressed. This study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that test subjects show logarithmic performance curves on repetitive trials for a component task of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a virtual reality simulator and that interindividual differences in performance after considerable training are significant. According to kinesiologic theory logarithmic performance curves are expected and an individuals learning capacity for a specific task can be extrapolated allowing quantification of a persons innate ability to develop task-specific skills."
