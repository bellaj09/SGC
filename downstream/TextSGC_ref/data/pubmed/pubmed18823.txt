Virtual reality VR is a promising technology in biomedical engineering but at the same time enlarges another problem called cybersickness. Aiming at suppression of cybersicknes we are investigating the influences of vection-induced images on the autonomic regulation quantitatively. We used the motion vectors to quantify image scenes and measured electrocardiogram blood pressure and respiration for evaluating the autonomic regulation. Using the estimated motion vectors we further synthesized random-dot pattern images to survey which component of the global motion vectors seriously affected the autonomic regulation. The results showed that the zoom component with a specific frequency band 0.1-3.0 Hz would induce sickness. Time-varying behavior of motion vectors in vection-induced images in relation to autonomic regulation.
