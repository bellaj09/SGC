This study investigates learning in aphasia as manifested through automatic priming effects. There is growing evidence that people with aphasia have impairments beyond language processing that could affect their response to treatment. Therefore better understanding these mechanisms would be beneficial for improving methods of rehabilitation. This study assesses semantic and repetition priming effects at varied interstimulus intervals using stimuli that are both non-linguistic and linguistic in tasks that range from requiring nearly no linguistic processing to requiring both lexical and semantic processing. Results indicate that people with aphasia maintain typical patterns of learning across both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks as long as the implicit prime-target relationship does not depend on deep levels of linguistic processing. As linguistic processing demands increase those with agrammatic aphasia may require more time to take advantage of learning through implicit prime-target relationships and people with both agrammatic and non-agrammatic aphasia are more susceptible to breakdown of the semantic networks as processing demands on that system increase. The time course of priming in aphasia: An exploration of learning along a continuum of linguistic processing demands.
