Virtual Reality VR technology is one of the most important innovations for research development and industrial production. In dentistry VR technology will be useful in providing better education through simulation and in enhancing working procedures that are conventionally limited e.g. the mechanical articulator. It is the purpose of this article to present concepts and strategies for a future replacement of the mechanical articulator by a virtual one. The virtual articulator in dentistry: concept and development.
