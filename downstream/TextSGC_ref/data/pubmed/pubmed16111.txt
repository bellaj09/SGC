The use of simulation-based medical education SBME in pediatrics has grown rapidly over the past 2 decades and is expected to continue to grow. Similar to other instructional formats used in medical education SBME is an instructional methodology that facilitates learning. Successful use of SBME in pediatrics requires attention to basic educational principles including the incorporation of clear learning objectives. To facilitate learning during simulation the psychological safety of the participants must be ensured and when done correctly SBME is a powerful tool to enhance patient safety in pediatrics. Here we provide an overview of SBME in pediatrics and review key topics in the field. We first review the tools of the trade and examine various types of simulators used in pediatric SBME including human patient simulators task trainers standardized patients and virtual reality simulation. Then we explore several uses of simulation that have been shown to lead to effective learning including curriculum integration feedback and debriefing deliberate practice mastery learning and range of difficulty and clinical variation. Examples of how these practices have been successfully used in pediatrics are provided. Finally we discuss the future of pediatric SBME. As a community pediatric simulation educators and researchers have been a leading force in the advancement of simulation in medicine. As the use of SBME in pediatrics expands we hope this perspective will serve as a guide for those interested in improving the state of pediatric SBME. Simulation-based medical education in pediatrics.
