Orthopedic education continues to move towards evidence-based curriculum in order to comply with new residency accreditation mandates. There are currently three high fidelity arthroscopic virtual reality VR simulators available each with multiple instructional modules and simulated arthroscopic procedures. The aim of the current study is to assess face validity defined as the degree to which a procedure appears effective in terms of its stated aims of three available VR simulators.
