Visualization of scientific data is crucial not only for scientific discovery but also to communicate science and medicine to both experts and a general audience. Until recently we have been limited to visualizing the three-dimensional 3D world of biology in 2 dimensions. Renderings of 3D cells are still traditionally displayed using two-dimensional 2D media such as on a computer screen or paper. However the advent of consumer grade virtual reality VR headsets such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive means it is now possible to visualize and interact with scientific data in a 3D virtual world. In addition new microscopic methods provide an unprecedented opportunity to obtain new 3D data sets. In this perspective article we highlight how we have used cutting edge imaging techniques to build a 3D virtual model of a cell from serial block-face scanning electron microscope SBEM imaging data. This model allows scientists students and members of the public to explore and interact with a "real" cell. Early testing of this immersive environment indicates a significant improvement in students\ understanding of cellular processes and points to a new future of learning and public engagement. In addition we speculate that VR can become a new tool for researchers studying cellular architecture and processes by populating VR models with molecular data.
