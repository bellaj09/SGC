Recent advances in diffusion-weighted MRI dMRI and tractography have enabled identification of major long-range white matter tracts in the human brain. Yet our understanding of shorter tracts such as those within the parietal lobe remains limited. Over a century ago a tract connecting the superior and inferior parts of the parietal cortex was identified in a post-mortem study: stratum proprium of interparietal sulcus SIPS; Sachs Das hemisphrenmark des menschlichen grosshirns. Verlag von georg thieme Leipzig 1892. The tract has since been replicated in another fibre dissection study Vergani et al. Cortex 56:145-156 2014 however it has not been fully investigated in the living human brain and its precise anatomical properties are yet to be described. We used dMRI and tractography to identify and characterise SIPS in vivo and explored its spatial proximity to the cortical areas associated with optic-flow processing using fMRI. SIPS was identified bilaterally in all subjects and its anatomical position and trajectory are consistent with previous post-mortem studies. Subsequent evaluation of the tractography results using the linear fascicle evaluation and virtual lesion analysis yielded strong statistical evidence for SIPS. We also found that the SIPS endpoints are adjacent to the optic-flow selective areas. In sum we show that SIPS is a short-range tract connecting the superior and inferior parts of the parietal cortex wrapping around the intraparietal sulcus and that it may be a crucial anatomy underlying optic-flow processing. In vivo identification and characterisation of SIPS will facilitate further research on SIPS in relation to cortical functions their development and diseases that affect them.
