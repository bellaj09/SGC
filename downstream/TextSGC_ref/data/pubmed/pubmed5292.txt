"Both resting state fMRI R-fMRI and task-based fMRI T-fMRI have been widely used to study the functional activities of the human brain during task-free and task-performance periods respectively. However due to the difficulty in strictly controlling the participating subjects mental status and their cognitive behaviors during R-fMRI/T-fMRI scans it has been challenging to ascertain whether or not an R-fMRI/T-fMRI scan truly reflects the participants functional brain states during task-free/task-performance periods. This paper presents a novel computational approach to characterizing and differentiating the brains functional status into task-free or task-performance states by which the functional brain activities can be effectively understood and differentiated. Briefly the brains functional state is represented by a whole-brain quasi-stable connectome pattern WQCP of R-fMRI or T-fMRI data based on 358 consistent cortical landmarks across individuals and then an effective sparse representation method was applied to learn the atomic connectome patterns ACPs of both task-free and task-performance states. Experimental results demonstrated that the learned ACPs for R-fMRI and T-fMRI datasets are substantially different as expected. A certain portion of ACPs from R-fMRI and T-fMRI data were overlapped suggesting some subjects with overlapping ACPs were not in the expected task-free/task-performance brain states. Besides potential outliers in the T-fMRI dataset were further investigated via functional activation detections in different groups and our results revealed unexpected task-performances of some subjects. This work offers novel insights into the functional architectures of the brain." Characterization of task-free and task-performance brain states via functional connectome patterns.
