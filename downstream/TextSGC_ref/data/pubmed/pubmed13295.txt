Multiple cause-of-death data provides a valuable source of information that can be used to enhance health standards by predicting health related trajectories in societies with large populations. These data are often available in large quantities across U.S. states and require Big Data techniques to uncover complex hidden patterns. We design two different classes of models suitable for large-scale analysis of mortality data a Hadoop-based ensemble of random forests trained over N-grams and the DeepDeath a deep classifier based on the recurrent neural network RNN. We apply both classes to the mortality data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and show that while both perform significantly better than the random classifier the deep model that utilizes long short-term memory networks LSTMs surpasses the N-gram based models and is capable of learning the temporal aspect of the data without a need for building ad-hoc expert-driven features.
