"The focus of this study is using data glove to practice Joint attention skill in virtual reality environment for people with pervasive developmental disorder PDD. The virtual reality environment provides a safe environment for PDD people. Especially when they made errors during practice in virtual reality environment there is no suffering or dangerous consequences to deal with. Joint attention is a critical skill in the disorder characteristics of children with PDD. The absence of joint attention is a deficit frequently affects their social relationship in daily life. Therefore this study designed the Joint Attention Skills Learning JASL systems with data glove tool to help children with PDD to practice joint attention behavior skills. The JASL specifically focus the skills of pointing showing sharing things and behavior interaction with other children with PDD. The system is designed in playroom-scene and presented in the first-person perspectives for users. The functions contain pointing and showing moving virtual objects 3D animation text speaking sounds and feedback. The method was employed single subject multiple-probe design across subjects designs and analysis of visual inspection in this study. It took 3 months to finish the experimental section. Surprisingly the experiment results reveal that the participants have further extension in improving the joint attention skills in their daily life after using the JASL system. The significant potential in this particular treatment of joint attention for each participant will be discussed in details in this paper."
