Functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS is an emerging technique for the in-vivo assessment of functional activity of the cerebral cortex as well as in the field of brain-computer-interface BCI research. A common challenge for the utilization of fNIRS for BCIs is a stable and reliable single trial classification of the recorded spatio-temporal hemodynamic patterns. Many different classification methods are available but up to now not more than two different classifiers were evaluated and compared on one data set. In this work we overcome this issue by comparing five different classification methods on mental arithmetic fNIRS data: linear discriminant analysis LDA quadratic discriminant analysis QDA support vector machines SVM analytic shrinkage regularized LDA sLDA and analytic shrinkage regularized QDA sQDA. Depending on the used method and feature type oxy-Hb or deoxy-Hb achieved classification results vary between 56.1 % deoxy-Hb/QDA and 86.6% oxy-Hb/SVM. We demonstrated that regularized classifiers perform significantly better than non-regularized ones. Considering simplicity and computational effort we recommend the use of sLDA for fNIRS-based BCIs.
