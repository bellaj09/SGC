"In clinical practice upper extremity motor impairments are commonly assessed with disease-specific subjectively scored and low-resolution rating scales that often do not consider the variations in tasks and environment that are essential aspects of daily life. Augmented reality AR systems with contactless tracking of the hand and upper body offer opportunities for objective quantification of motor dysfunction in a challenging engaging and patient-tailored environment. In this study we explore the potential of AR for evaluating 1 speed and goal-directedness of movements within the individually determined interaction space 2 adaptation of hand opening to objects of different sizes and 3 obstacle avoidance in healthy individuals N\u2009=\u200910 and two highly prevalent neurological conditions N\u2009=\u200910 patients with Parkinsons Disease and N\u2009=\u200910 stroke patients. We successfully implemented three AR games to evaluate these key aspects of motor function. As expected PD patients moved slower than controls and needed more time for task completion. No differences were observed between stroke patients and controls perhaps because motor impairments in this patient group were relatively mild. Importantly usability of our AR system was good and considerably improved compared to our previous study due to more natural and patient-tailored interaction. Although our findings testify to the potential of AR for assessing motor impairments in patients with neurological conditions and provide starting points for further improvement there are still many steps to be taken towards application in clinical practice."
