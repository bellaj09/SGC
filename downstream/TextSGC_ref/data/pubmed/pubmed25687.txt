Chronic spinal cord injury SCI patients present poor motor cortex activation during movement attempts. The reactivation of this brain region can be beneficial for them for instance allowing them to use brain-machine interfaces for motor rehabilitation or restoration. These brain-machine interfacess generally use electroencephalography EEG to measure the cortical activation during the attempts of movement quantifying it as the event-related desynchronization ERD of the alpha/mu rhythm. Based on previous evidence showing that higher tonic EEG alpha power is associated with higher ERD we hypothesized that artificially increasing the alpha power over the motor cortex of these patients could enhance their ERD ie motor cortical activation during movement attempts. We used EEG neurofeedback NF to enhance the tonic EEG alpha power providing real-time visual feedback of the alpha oscillations measured over the motor cortex. This approach was evaluated in a C4 ASIA A SCI patient 9 months after the injury who did not present ERD during the movement attempts of his paralyzed hands. The patient performed 4 NF sessions in 4 consecutive days and screenings of his EEG activity before and after each session. After the intervention the patient presented a significant increase in the alpha power over the motor cortex and a significant enhancement of the mu ERD in the contralateral motor cortex when he attempted to close the assessed right hand. As a proof of concept investigation this article shows how a short NF intervention might be used to enhance the motor cortical activation in patients with chronic tetraplegia.
