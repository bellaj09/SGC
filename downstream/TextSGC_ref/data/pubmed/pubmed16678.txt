The combined disease of the aortic arch and the descending aorta aneurysms and dissection remains a surgical challenge. Various approaches have been used to treat this complex pathology. In the two-stage operation at the first-stage operation the aortic arch is replaced through a median sternotomy. Later at the second-stage operation the descending thoracic aorta is replaced through a lateral thoracotomy. The elephant trunk ET technique was introduced by H.G. Borst at our centre in March 1982 greatly simplifying the second-phase operation. We present our 30-year experience. Total aortic arch replacement with the elephant trunk technique: single-centre 30-year results.
