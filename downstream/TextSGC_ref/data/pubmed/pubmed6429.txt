The difficulty to understand diagnose and treat neurological disorders stems from the great complexity of the central nervous system on different levels of physiological granularity. The individual components their interactions and dynamics involved in brain development and function can be represented as molecular cellular or functional networks where diseases are perturbations of networks. These networks can become a useful research tool in investigating neurological disorders if they are properly tailored to reflect corresponding mechanisms. Here we review approaches to construct networks specific for neurological disorders describing disease-related pathology on different scales: the molecular cellular and brain level. We also briefly discuss cross-scale network analysis as a necessary integrator of these scales. Neurological Diseases from a Systems Medicine Point of View.
