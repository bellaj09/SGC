In order to provide effective care to patients suffering from chronic pain secondary to neurological diseases health professionals must appraise the role of the psychosocial factors in the genesis and maintenance of this condition whilst considering how emotions and cognitions influence the course of treatment.

As an extensive evaluation of these factors is still lacking the Italian Consensus Conference on Pain in Neurorehabilitation ICCPN aimed to collate the evidence available across these topics.
