"Conditional random fields CRFs are demonstrated to be a discriminative model able to exploit the temporal properties of EEG data obtained during synchronous three-class motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. The advantages of CRFs over the hidden Markov model HMM are both theoretical and practical. Theoretically CRFs focus on modeling latent variables labels rather than both observation and latent variables. Furthermore CRFs loss function is convex guaranteeing convergence to the global optimum. Practically CRFs are much less prone to singularity problems. This property allows for the use of both time- and frequency-based features such as band power. The HMM on the other hand requires temporal features such as autoregressive coefficients. A CRF-based classifier is tested on 13 subjects. Significant improvement is found when applying CRFs over HMM- and LDA-based classifiers."
