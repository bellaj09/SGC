Quality assessment of diffusion MRI dMRI data is essential prior to any analysis so that appropriate pre-processing can be used to improve data quality and ensure that the presence of MRI artifacts do not affect the results of subsequent image analysis. Manual quality assessment of the data is subjective possibly error-prone and infeasible especially considering the growing number of consortium-like studies underlining the need for automation of the process. In this paper we have developed a deep-learning-based automated quality control QC tool QC-Automator for dMRI data that can handle a variety of artifacts such as motion multiband interleaving ghosting susceptibility herringbone and chemical shifts. QC-Automator uses convolutional neural networks along with transfer learning to train the automated artifact detection on a labeled dataset of 332000 slices of dMRI data from 155 unique subjects and 5 scanners with different dMRI acquisitions achieving a 98% accuracy in detecting artifacts. The method is fast and paves the way for efficient and effective artifact detection in large datasets. It is also demonstrated to be replicable on other datasets with different acquisition parameters. QC-Automator: Deep Learning-Based Automated Quality Control for Diffusion MR Images.
