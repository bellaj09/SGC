"Bio-robots based on brain computer interface BCI suffer from the lack of considering the characteristic of the animals in navigation. This paper proposed a new method for bio-robots automatic navigation combining the reward generating algorithm base on Reinforcement Learning RL with the learning intelligence of animals together. Given the graded electrical reward the animal e.g. the rat intends to seek the maximum reward while exploring an unknown environment. Since the rat has excellent spatial recognition the rat-robot and the RL algorithm can convergent to an optimal route by co-learning. This work has significant inspiration for the practical development of bio-robots navigation with hybrid intelligence."
