Interactive multi-agent simulation algorithms are used to compute the trajectories and behaviors of different entities in virtual reality scenarios. However current methods involve considerable parameter tweaking to generate plausible behaviors. We introduce a novel approach Heter-Sim that combines physics-based simulation methods with data-driven techniques using an optimization-based formulation. Our approach is general and can simulate heterogeneous agents corresponding to human crowds traffic vehicles or combinations of different agents with varying dynamics. We estimate motion states from real-world datasets that include information about position velocity and control direction. Our optimization algorithm considers several constraints including velocity continuity collision avoidance attraction direction control. Other constraints are implemented by introducing a novel energy function to control the motions of heterogeneous agents. To accelerate the computations we reduce the search space for both collision avoidance and optimal solution computation. Heter-Sim can simulate tens or hundreds of agents at interactive rates and we compare its accuracy with real-world datasets and prior algorithms. We also perform user studies that evaluate the plausible behaviors generated by our algorithm and a user study that evaluates the plausibility of our algorithm via VR.
