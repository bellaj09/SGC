Investigating human brain function is essential to develop models of cortical involvement during walking. Such models could advance the analysis of motor impairments following brain injuries e.g. stroke and may lead to novel rehabilitation approaches. In this work we applied high-density EEG source imaging based on individual anatomy to enable neuroimaging during walking. To minimize the impact of muscular influence on EEG recordings we introduce a novel artifact correction method based on spectral decomposition. High  oscillations >60Hz were previously reported to play an important role in motor control. Here we investigate high  amplitudes while focusing on two different aspects of a walking experiment namely the fact that a person walks and the rhythmicity of walking. We found that high  amplitudes 60-80Hz located focally in central sensorimotor areas were significantly increased during walking compared to standing. Moreover high  70-90Hz amplitudes in the same areas are modulated in relation to the gait cycle. Since the spectral peaks of high  amplitude increase and modulation do not match it is plausible that these two high  elements represent different frequency-specific network interactions. Interestingly we found high  70-90Hz amplitudes to be coupled to low  24-40Hz amplitudes which both are modulated in relation to the gait cycle but conversely to each other. In summary our work is a further step towards modeling cortical involvement during human upright walking. High and low gamma EEG oscillations in central sensorimotor areas are conversely modulated during the human gait cycle.
