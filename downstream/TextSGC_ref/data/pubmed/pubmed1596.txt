SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19. RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp. Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutation hot spots include a novel RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase variant.
