Improving the accuracy and efficiency of bridge structure damage detection is one of the main challenges in engineering practice. This paper aims to address this issue by monitoring the continuous bridge deflection based on the fiber optic gyroscope and applying the deep-learning algorithm to perform structural damage detection. With a scale-down bridge model three types of damage scenarios and an intact benchmark were simulated. A supervised learning model based on the deep convolutional neural networks was proposed. After the training process under ten-fold cross-validation the model accuracy can reach 96.9% and significantly outperform that of other four traditional machine learning methods random forest support vector machine k-nearest neighbor and decision tree used for comparison. Further the proposed model illustrated its decent ability in distinguishing damage from structurally symmetrical locations.
