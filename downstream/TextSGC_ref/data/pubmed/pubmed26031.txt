Two-dimensional cursor control is an important and challenging issue in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs. To address this issue here we propose a new approach by combining two brain signals including Mu/Beta rhythm during motor imagery and P300 potential. In particular a motor imagery detection mechanism and a P300 potential detection mechanism are devised and integrated such that the user is able to use the two signals to control respectively simultaneously and independently the horizontal and the vertical movements of the cursor in a specially designed graphic user interface. A real-time BCI system based on this approach is implemented and evaluated through an online experiment involving six subjects performing 2-D control tasks. The results attest to the efficacy of obtaining two independent control signals by the proposed approach. Furthermore the results show that the system has merit compared with prior systems: it allows cursor movement between arbitrary positions.
