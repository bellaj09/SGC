"The discussion about violent video games tends to engender extreme positions each of which are deserving of deep skepticism. Fergusons 2015 this issue claim that humans can do something repeatedly with no effect on them should be examined carefully especially as it violates most established psychological and learning theories. In this commentary we examine three aspects of Fergusons claim. First it is a typical rhetorical trick to sow doubt but it is valuable to examine the doubting claims. Second it is good rhetoric to direct attention in only one direction but it is valuable to examine that direction within its broader outlook. Third it is good rhetoric to imply bias on the part of one position but it is valuable to examine the potential biases on all sides. Good science definitely requires skeptics. The problem with the violent video game debate is perhaps that we have not been skeptical enough." What Is a Good Skeptic to Do? The Case for Skepticism in the Media Violence Discussion.
