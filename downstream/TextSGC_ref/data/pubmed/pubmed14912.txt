Internal states including affective or homeostatic states are important behavioral motivators. The amygdala regulates motivated behaviors yet how distinct states are represented in amygdala circuits is unknown. By longitudinally imaging neural calcium dynamics in freely moving mice across different environments we identified opponent changes in activity levels of two major nonoverlapping populations of basal amygdala principal neurons. This population signature does not report global anxiety but predicts switches between exploratory and nonexploratory defensive states. Moreover the amygdala separately processes external stimuli and internal states and broadcasts state information via several output pathways to larger brain networks. Our findings extend the concept of thalamocortical "brain-state" coding to include affective and exploratory states and provide an entry point into the state dependency of brain function and behavior in defined circuits. Amygdala ensembles encode behavioral states.
