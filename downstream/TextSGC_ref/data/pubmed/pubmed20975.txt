Brief high-intensity cycling is popular because physiological benefits accrue with a short workout time but burning pain in the quadriceps is a potential barrier to engaging in this type of exercise. Virtual reality VR can temporarily decrease pain but its effect on muscle pain during high-intensity exercise is unknown. The primary purpose of this experiment was to test whether adding interactive VR I-VR to high-intensity cycling could reduce quadriceps pain or improve performance. Interactive Virtual Reality Reduces Quadriceps Pain during High-Intensity Cycling.
