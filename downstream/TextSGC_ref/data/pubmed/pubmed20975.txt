"Spatial memory allows us to locate objects and organisms in space and move through the environment. We frequently use two strategies for this purpose: egocentric related to the viewers perspective and allocentric associated with environmental cues. This ability is usually assessed by 2D or virtual reality-based tasks. Gender differences have been reported on these tasks. We designed two card-placing tasks with the aim of assessing egocentric and allocentric spatial memory in a real environment. This task makes it possible to separately compare egocentric and allocentric strategies providing participants with 3D information naturally present in daily orientation activities. We will assess the performance of male and female young adults on the two strategies. Ninety-four subjects were recruited and performed egocentric and allocentric spatial memory card placing tasks. Spatial Span forward and backward was also assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Assessment Battery CANTAB and the brief version of Bentons Judge of Line Orientation Test JoLO was used to evaluate the ability to judge spatial relations. Our results show that men outperformed women on both spatial memory tasks. Women performed better on Allocentric tasks than on Egocentric tasks whereas mens scores did not show differences between strategies. Spatial memory performance on the card placing tasks was significantly correlated with performance on the backward visuospatial span from the CANTAB. This study supports the existence of gender differences in spatial memory functioning and it provides novel tools for the neuropsychological assessment of spatial memory."
