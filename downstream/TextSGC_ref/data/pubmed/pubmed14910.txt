Single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq is an emerging technology that can assess the function of an individual cell and cell-to-cell variability at the single cell level in an unbiased manner. Dimensionality reduction is an essential first step in downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. However the scRNA-seq data are challenging for traditional methods due to their high dimensional measurements as well as an abundance of dropout events that is zero expression measurements. A deep adversarial variational autoencoder model for dimensionality reduction in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.
