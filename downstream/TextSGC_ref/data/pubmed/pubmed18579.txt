"Precise simulators can replicate complete understanding of the models. In this survey we focus on orthopedic simulators that are not only in replicating real-world models but also in educating with complete procedure: surgical for instance. It covers 18 hip replacement three-knee replacement three facial surgeries one spine surgery and six orthopedic psycho-motor skills training and assessment-based simulators. We also provide comparative studies and highlight current trends and possible challenges. We observed that orthopedic training methodologies have undergone a paradigm shift. This means that the simulators replace the use of sensitive hospital settings for training and skill acquisition. In brief we address classified overview on existing orthopedic simulators: physical and Virtual Reality VR-based simulators. Key steps to develop computer-assisted VR-based simulator are explored. Experts opinion on the use of simulation technologies in the field of orthopedics is discussed." A Systematic Review on Orthopedic Simulators for Psycho-Motor Skill and Surgical Procedure Training.
