"Sensory processing is the ability to capture elaborate and integrate information through the five senses and is impaired in over 90% of children with autism spectrum disorder ASD. The ASD population shows hyper-hypo sensitiveness to sensory stimuli that can generate alteration in information processing affecting cognitive and social responses to daily life situations. Structured and semi-structured interviews are generally used for ASD assessment and the evaluation relies on the examiners subjectivity and expertise which can lead to misleading outcomes. Recently there has been a growing need for more objective reliable and valid diagnostic measures such as biomarkers to distinguish typical from atypical functioning and to reliably track the progression of the illness helping to diagnose ASD. Implicit measures and ecological valid settings have been showing high accuracy on predicting outcomes and correctly classifying populations in categories."
