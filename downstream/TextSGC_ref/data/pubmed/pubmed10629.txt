Research in science technology engineering and mathematics STEM fields has become much more complex in the twenty-first century. As a result the students of our Graduate School who are all Ph.D. candidates need to be trained in essential skills and processes that are crucial for success in academia and beyond. Some research problems are inherently complex in that they raise deep moral dilemmas such as antimicrobial resistance sustainability dual-use research of concern defined as well-intentioned scientific research that may be misused for nefarious purposes and human cloning. Dealing with moral dilemmas is one of several core competencies that twenty-first-century Ph.D. students must acquire. However this might prove difficult for STEM Ph.D. students who have had limited exposure to moral philosophy. Since the task of dealing with moral dilemmas in STEM research requires input from both scientific and philosophical disciplines it is argued with the help of the 4 examples above that this task be explicitly modelled as an interdisciplinary process. Furthermore it is argued that a particular model from the interdisciplinary education literature could serve as a learning tool to support ethical decision-making in research ethics and integrity courses for doctoral students. Training STEM Ph.D. Students to Deal with Moral Dilemmas.
