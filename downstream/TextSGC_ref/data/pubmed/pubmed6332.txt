Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging mMRI has been widely used to map the structure and function of the human brain as well as its behavioral associations. However to date a large sample with a long-term longitudinal design and a narrow age-span has been lacking for the assessment of test-retest reliability and reproducibility of brain-behavior correlations as well as the development of novel causal insights into these correlational findings. Here we describe the SLIM dataset which includes brain and behavioral data across a long-term retest-duration within three and a half years mMRI scans provided a set of structural diffusion and resting-state functional MRI images along with rich samples of behavioral assessments addressed-demographic cognitive and emotional information. Together with the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility CoRR the SLIM is expected to accelerate the reproducible sciences of the human brain by providing an open resource for brain-behavior discovery sciences with big-data approaches.
