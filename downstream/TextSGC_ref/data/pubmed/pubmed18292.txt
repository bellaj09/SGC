"Parents can play a crucial role in the development of childrens behaviors associated with dietary habits physical activity and sedentary lifestyles. Many parenting practices and/or styles measures have been developed; however there is little agreement as to how the influence of parenting should be measured. More importantly our ability to relate parenting practices and/or styles to childrens behaviors depends on its accurate assessment. While there is a need to standardize our assessment to further advance knowledge in this area this article will discuss areas that may stimulate advances in the measurement of parenting constructs. Because self-report measures are important for the assessment of parenting this article discusses whether solutions to improve self-report measures may lie in: 1 Improving the questions asked; 2 improving the methods used to correct for social desirability or measurement errors; 3 changing our measurement paradigm to assess implicit parenting behaviors; 4 changing how self-report is collected by taking advantage of ecological momentary assessment methods; 5 using better psychometric methods to validate parenting measures or alternatively using advances in psychometric methods such as item banking and computerized adaptive testing to solve common administration issues i.e. response burden and comparability of results across studies; and 6 employing novel technologies to collect data such as portable technologies gaming and virtual reality simulation. This article will briefly discuss the potential of technologies to measure parenting constructs." Stimulating innovations in the measurement of parenting constructs.
