The Federal Highway Administration FHWA proposed guidelines for highway design to increase the safe driving ability of older drivers; however little empirical evidence exists to support the effectiveness of these guidelines. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of implementing these guidelines in 4 pairs of intersections on safe driving performance of older and younger drivers using a high-fidelity driving simulator. The impact of intersection design on simulated driving performance of young and senior adults.
