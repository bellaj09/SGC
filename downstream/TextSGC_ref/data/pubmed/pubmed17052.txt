Hand burns cause functional impairment. Leap motion control LMC a kind of virtual reality games employs a novel system that provides biofeedback and training of fine motor function and functional skills. In this study we hypothesized that LMC would improve burned hand function. Sixteen participants were allocated to either the LMC group or the control group. The LMC group played 20min identical leap motion video games after 40min traditional occupational therapy OT. The control group received traditional OT for 60min. Both groups received interventions 2 days a week for 4 months. A series of questionnaires were administered including BSHS-B QuickDASH iADL and Barthel index. Data on baseline characteristics including joint range of motion ROM grip and pinch strength and scar thickness were obtained. Furthermore we used the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for comparison as appropriate. We found improvements in BSHS-B QuickDASH and iADL in the LMC group all p<0.05 compared to those in the control group. In the LMC-trained hand the ROM of the thumb IP joint and pinch strength increased whereas the scar thickness over the first dorsal interossei muscle decreased p<0.05. In conclusion leap motion training could help patients with hand burns to increase finger ROM decrease scar thickness and improve hand function.
