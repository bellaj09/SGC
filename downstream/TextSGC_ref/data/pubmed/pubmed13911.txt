In this paper we propose a novel method for magnetic resonance imaging based Alzheimer\s disease AD or mild cognitive impairment MCI diagnosis that systematically integrates voxel-based region-based and patch-based approaches into a unified framework. Specifically we parcellate the brain into predefined regions based on anatomical knowledge i.e. templates and derive complex nonlinear relationships among voxels whose intensities denote volumetric measurements within each region. Unlike existing methods that use cubical or rectangular shapes we consider the anatomical shapes of regions as atypical patches. Using complex nonlinear relationships among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks we extract a "regional abnormality representation." We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over the entire brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing these observations in the brain space. On the baseline MRI dataset from the Alzheimer\s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI cohort our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for four binary classification tasks and one three-class classification task. Additionally we conducted exhaustive experiments and analysis to validate the efficacy and potential of our method.
