"Understanding the organization of the hippocampus is fundamental to understanding brain function related to learning memory emotions and diseases such as Alzheimers disease. Physiological studies in humans and rodents have suggested that there is both structural and functional heterogeneity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. However the recent discovery of discrete gene expression domains in the mouse hippocampus has provided the opportunity to re-evaluate hippocampal connectivity. To integrate mouse hippocampal gene expression and connectivity we mapped the distribution of distinct gene expression patterns in mouse hippocampus and subiculum to create the Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas HGEA. Notably previously unknown subiculum gene expression patterns revealed a hidden laminar organization. Guided by the HGEA we constructed the most detailed hippocampal connectome available using Mouse Connectome Project  http://www.mouseconnectome.org  tract tracing data. Our results define the hippocampus multiscale network organization and elucidate each subnetworks unique brain-wide connectivity patterns." Integration of gene expression and brain-wide connectivity reveals the multiscale organization of mouse hippocampal networks.
