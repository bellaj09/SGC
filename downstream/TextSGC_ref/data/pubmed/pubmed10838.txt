Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal disorder in adolescents with a prevalence of 0.5-5.2% worldwide. The traditional methods for scoliosis screening are easily accessible but require unnecessary referrals and radiography exposure due to their low positive predictive values. The application of deep learning algorithms has the potential to reduce unnecessary referrals and costs in scoliosis screening. Here we developed and validated deep learning algorithms for automated scoliosis screening using unclothed back images. The accuracies of the algorithms were superior to those of human specialists in detecting scoliosis detecting cases with a curve 20 and severity grading for both binary classifications and the four-class classification. Our approach can be potentially applied in routine scoliosis screening and periodic follow-ups of pretreatment cases without radiation exposure.
