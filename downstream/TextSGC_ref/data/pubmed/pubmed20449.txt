Virtual reality technologies show potential as effective rehabilitation tools following neuro-trauma. In particular the Elements system involving customized surface computing and tangible interfaces produces strong treatment effects for upper-limb and cognitive function following traumatic brain injury. The present study evaluated the efficacy of Elements as a virtual rehabilitation approach for stroke survivors. Elements virtual rehabilitation improves motor cognitive and functional outcomes in adult stroke: evidence from a randomized controlled pilot study.
