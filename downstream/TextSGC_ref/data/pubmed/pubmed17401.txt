"We have constructed a haptic immersive workbench to be placed in the patients home for daily adjusted rehabilitation. We also propose a system for Internet based connection and communication between patients and between patients and a clinical rehabilitation center and clinical assessment/evaluation centers. The benefits of a system for rehabilitation after stroke based on VR Haptics and Telemedicine should be: increased quality of life lesser isolation feeling more secure fewer tiring transportations more frequent exercising better compliance to training lower cost for transportation. The long term recovery for a larger group of patients with motor impairments is presently under evaluation." Rehabilitation after stroke using virtual reality haptics force feedback and telemedicine.
