An accurate forecasting of outbreaks of influenza-like illness ILI could support public health officials to suggest public health actions earlier. We investigated the performance of three different feature spaces in different models to forecast the weekly ILI rate in Syria using EWARS data from World Health Organization WHO. Time series feature space was first used and we applied the seven models which are Nave Average Seasonal nave drift dynamic harmonic regression Dhr seasonal and trend decomposition using loess STL and TBATS. The Second feature space is like some state-of-the-art which we named Formula: see text feature space. The third one we proposed and named Formula: see text YnWm feature space. Machine learning ML and deep learning DL model were applied to the second and third feature spaces generalized linear model GLM support vector regression SVR gradient boosting GB random forest RF and long short term memory LSTM. A comparative study on predicting influenza outbreaks using different feature spaces: application of influenza-like illness data from Early Warning Alert and Response System in Syria.
