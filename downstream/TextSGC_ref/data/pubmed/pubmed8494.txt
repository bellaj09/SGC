The calcaneus is the most fracture-prone tarsal bone and injuries to the surrounding tissue are some of the most difficult to treat. Currently there is a lack of consensus on treatment or interpretation of computed tomography CT images for calcaneus fractures. This study proposes a novel computer-assisted method for automated classification and detection of fracture locations in calcaneus CT images using a deep learning algorithm. Deep learning and SURF for automated classification and detection of calcaneus fractures in CT images.
