Early detection remains a significant challenge for the treatment of depression. In our work we proposed a novel approach to mild depression recognition using electroencephalography EEG. First we explored abnormal organization in the functional connectivity network of mild depression using graph theory. Second we proposed a novel classification model for recognizing mild depression. Considering the powerful ability of CNN to process two-dimensional data we applied CNN separately to the two-dimensional data form of the functional connectivity matrices from five EEG bands delta theta alpha beta and gamma. In addition inspired by recent breakthroughs in the ability of deep recurrent CNNs to classify mental load we merged the functional connectivity matrices from the three EEG bands that performed the best into a three-channel image to classify mild depression-related and normal EEG signals using the CNN. The results of the graph theory analysis showed that the brain functional network of the mild depression group had a larger characteristic path length and a lower clustering coefficient than the healthy control group showing deviation from the small-world network. The proposed classification model obtained a classification accuracy of 80.74% for recognizing mild depression. The current study suggests that the combination of a CNN and functional connectivity matrix may provide a promising objective approach for diagnosing mild depression. Deep learning approaches such as this might have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.
