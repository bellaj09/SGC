Bioelectrodes for neural recording and neurostimulation are an integral component of a number of neuroprosthetic devices including the commercially available cochlear implant and developmental devices such as the bionic eye and brain-machine interfaces. Current electrode designs limit the application of such devices owing to suboptimal material properties that lead to minimal interaction with the target neural tissue and the formation of fibrotic capsules. In designing an ideal bioelectrode a number of design criteria must be considered with respect to physical mechanical electrical and biological properties. Conducting polymers have the potential to address the synergistic interaction of these properties and show promise as superior coatings for next-generation electrodes in implant devices.
