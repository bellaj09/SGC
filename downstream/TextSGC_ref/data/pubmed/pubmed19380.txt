"The principal interest of virtual reality is its potential to create experiments close to daily life with a perfect experimental control. In a first time we review the studies illustrating the contribution of virtual reality for neuropsychology mainly for memory study. In a second time we present the results of an experiment in which the subjects were driving in a virtual town that tested all the episodic memory components i.e. the memories of what where and when events happened. Young and elderly adults performed the virtual test either with intentional or incidental encoding and either in active they drove a virtual car or passive exploration of the town they were passengers. The results showed that older subjects recalled the spatiotemporal context and the details of the events in a lower proportion than younger as well in active as in passive condition. Subjects memory complaints were correlated with the virtual scores but not with usual verbal episodic memory tests. Therefore virtual tests seem to allow a better assessment of episodic memory than the usual ones especially because of their spatiotemporal memory assessment and appear to be a hopeful tool for a neuropsychology closer to patients daily life than the usual tests."
