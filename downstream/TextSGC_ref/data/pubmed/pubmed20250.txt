"The fear of speaking is often cited as the worlds most common social phobia. The rapid growth of computer technology has enabled the use of virtual reality VR for the treatment of the fear of public speaking. There are two techniques for building virtual environments for the treatment of this fear: a model-based and a movie-based method. Both methods have the weakness that they are unrealistic and not controllable individually. To understand these disadvantages this paper presents a virtual environment produced with Image Based Rendering IBR and a chroma-key simultaneously. IBR enables the creation of realistic virtual environments where the images are stitched panoramically with the photos taken from a digital camera. And the use of chroma-keys puts virtual audience members under individual control in the environment. In addition real time capture technique is used in constructing the virtual environments enabling spoken interaction between the subject and a therapist or another subject."
