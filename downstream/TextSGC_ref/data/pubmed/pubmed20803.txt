Current immersive VR systems such as the CAVE provide an effective platform for the immersive exploration of large 3D data. A major limitation is that in most cases at least one display surface is missing due to space access or cost constraints. This partially-immersive visualization results in a substantial loss of visual information that may be acceptable for some applications however it becomes a major obstacle for critical tasks such as the analysis of medical data. We propose a conformal deformation rendering pipeline for the visualization of datasets on partially-immersive platforms. The angle-preserving conformal mapping approach is used to map the 3603D view volume to arbitrary display configurations. It has the desirable property of preserving shapes under distortion which is important for identifying features especially in medical data. The conformal mapping is used for rasterization realtime raytracing and volume rendering of the datasets. Since the technique is applied during the rendering we can construct stereoscopic images from the data which is usually not true for image-based distortion approaches. We demonstrate the stereo conformal mapping rendering pipeline in the partially-immersive 5-wall Immersive Cabin IC for virtual colonoscopy and architectural review.
