How do we lastingly change our lives for the better? There is not an easy answer to this question. However due to the advances in psychology and neuroscience now we have a better view of personal change that is not limited to a specific viewpoint. In particular the emergence of integrative and transdiagnostic accounts suggests that change is contextual depending on the person the issues and the situation. More personal change is a process happening in discontinuous and nonlinear ways following life transitions and traumatic events. In this process a key role can be played by technology: using the "Positive Technology" approach it is possible to use technology to manipulate the quality of experience with the goal of increasing wellness and generating strengths and resilience in individuals organizations and society. Positive change: connecting the virtual and the real.
