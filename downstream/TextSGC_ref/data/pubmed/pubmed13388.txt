Spatial resolution is one of the key parameters of magnetic resonance imaging MRI. The image super-resolution SR technique offers an alternative approach to improve the spatial resolution of MRI due to its simplicity. Convolutional neural networks CNN-based SR algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in which the global residual learning GRL strategy is now commonly used due to its effectiveness for learning image details for SR. However the partial loss of image details usually happens in a very deep network due to the degradation problem. In this work we propose a novel residual learning-based SR algorithm for MRI which combines both multi-scale GRL and shallow network block-based local residual learning LRL. The proposed LRL module works effectively in capturing high-frequency details by learning local residuals. One simulated MRI dataset and two real MRI datasets have been used to evaluate our algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed SR algorithm achieves superior performance to all of the other compared CNN-based SR algorithms in this work.
