This study is part of a larger project regarding the development of a Spine Surgery Simulator S3 which has shown good results for posterior instrumentation surgeries. The aim was to develop a biomechanical model for the anterior instrumentation of the scoliotic spine. A biomechanical model using flexible mechanism was developed and surgical manoeuvres instrumentation rod installation and compression were reproduced. Validation of the model was done by comparing the results for the instrumented part of the spine to the post-operative data analytical Cobb angles in the frontal and sagittal planes plane of maximum deformity etc.. To date surgeries of four patients operated by thoracotomy were reproduced. Preliminary results show that anterior instrumentation of the scoliotic spine can be adequately modelled using pre-operative geometric data and using mechanical properties from literature. Once validated with a larger sample of cases the anterior instrumentation model could be implemented into S3 and used by orthopaedic surgeons to test various instrumentation strategies in virtual reality before performing the actual surgery.
