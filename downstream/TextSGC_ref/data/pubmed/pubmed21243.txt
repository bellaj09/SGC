"Nurse-led gastrointestinal endoscopy is a priority clinical area in the UK. Endoscopic procedures are challenging to learn requiring a combination of technical competence manipulating a flexible endoscope and interpreting the findings and interpersonal skills engaging effectively with a conscious patient who is frequently apprehensive. This paper explores the potential of an innovative scenario-based approach which links a simulated patient with a computer-driven virtual reality VR training device for flexible sigmoidoscopy. Within this safe yet realistic quasi-clinical environment learners carry out the procedure while interacting with the patient. Communication skills are assessed by simulated patients while quantitative performance data relating to the procedure is generated automatically by the VR simulator."
