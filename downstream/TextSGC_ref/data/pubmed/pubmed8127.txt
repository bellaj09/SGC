Domain adaptation DA is widely used in learning problems lacking labels. Recent studies show that deep adversarial DA models can make markable improvements in performance which include symmetric and asymmetric architectures. However the former has poor generalization ability whereas the latter is very hard to train. In this article we propose a novel adversarial DA method named adversarial residual transform networks ARTNs to improve the generalization ability which directly transforms the source features into the space of target features. In this model residual connections are used to share features and adversarial loss is reconstructed thus making the model more generalized and easier to train. Moreover a special regularization term is added to the loss function to alleviate a vanishing gradient problem which enables its training process stable. A series of experiments based on Amazon review data set digits data sets and Office-31 image data sets are conducted to show that the proposed ARTN can be comparable with the methods of the state of the art.
