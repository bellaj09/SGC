Sharp-wave ripples SPW-Rs in the hippocampus are implied in memory consolidation as shown by observational and interventional experiments. However the mechanism of their generation remains unclear. Using two-dimensional silicon probe arrays we investigated the propagation of SPW-Rs across the hippocampal CA1 CA2 and CA3 subregions. Synchronous activation of CA2 ensembles preceded SPW-R-related population activity in CA3 and CA1 regions. Deep CA2 neurons gradually increased their activity prior to ripples and were suppressed during the population bursts of CA3-CA1 neurons ramping cells. Activity of superficial CA2 cells preceded the activity surge in CA3-CA1 phasic cells. The trigger role of the CA2 region in SPW-R was more pronounced during waking than sleeping. These results point to the CA2 region as an initiation zone for SPW-Rs. Role of Hippocampal CA2 Region in Triggering Sharp-Wave Ripples.
