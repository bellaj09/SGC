Plasticity theory aims at describing the yield loci and work hardening of a material under general deformation states. Most of its complexity arises from the nontrivial dependence of the yield loci on the complete strain history of a material and its microstructure. This motivated 3 ingenious simplifications that underpinned a century of developments in this field: 1 yield criteria describing yield loci location; 2 associative or nonassociative flow rules defining the direction of plastic flow; and 3 effective stress-strain laws consistent with the plastic work equivalence principle. However 2 key complications arise from these simplifications. First finding equations that describe these 3 assumptions for materials with complex microstructures is not trivial. Second yield surface evolution needs to be traced iteratively i.e. through a return mapping algorithm. Here we show that these assumptions are not needed in the context of sequence learning when using recurrent neural networks diverting the above-mentioned complications. This work offers an alternative to currently established plasticity formulations by providing the foundations for finding history- and microstructure-dependent constitutive models through deep learning. Deep learning predicts path-dependent plasticity.
