Automatic identification of specific osseous landmarks on the spinal radiograph can be used to automate calculations for correcting ligament instability and injury which affect 75% of patients injured in motor vehicle accidents. In this work we propose to use deep learning based object detection method as the first step towards identifying landmark points in lateral lumbar X-ray images. The significant breakthrough of deep learning technology has made it a prevailing choice for perception based applications however the lack of large annotated training dataset has brought challenges to utilizing the technology in medical image processing field. In this work we propose to fine tune a deep network Faster-RCNN a state-of-the-art deep detection network in natural image domain using small annotated clinical datasets. In the experiment we show that by using only 81 lateral lumbar X-Ray training images one can achieve much better performance compared to traditional sliding window detection method on hand crafted features. Furthermore we fine-tuned the network using 974 training images and tested on 108 images which achieved average precision of 0.905 with average computation time of 3 second per image which greatly outperformed traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
