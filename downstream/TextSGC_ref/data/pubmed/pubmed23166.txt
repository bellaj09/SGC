A significant benefit of virtual reality VR simulation is the ability to provide self-direct learning for trainees. This study aims to determine whether there are any differences in performance of cadaver temporal bone dissections between novices who received traditional teaching methods and those who received unsupervised self-directed learning in a VR temporal bone simulator. Improving temporal bone dissection using self-directed virtual reality simulation: results of a randomized blinded control trial.
