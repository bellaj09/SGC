"The exponential growth in population and their overall reliance on the usage of electrical and electronic devices have increased the demand for energy production. It needs precise energy management systems that can forecast the usage of the consumers for future policymaking. Embedded smart sensors attached to electricity meters and home appliances enable power suppliers to effectively analyze the energy usage to generate and distribute electricity into residential areas based on their level of energy consumption. Therefore this paper proposes a clustering-based analysis of energy consumption to categorize the consumers electricity usage into different levels. First a deep autoencoder that transfers the low-dimensional energy consumption data to high-level representations was trained. Second the high-level representations were fed into an adaptive self-organizing map SOM clustering algorithm. Afterward the levels of electricity energy consumption were established by conducting the statistical analysis on the obtained clustered data. Finally the results were visualized in graphs and calendar views and the predicted levels of energy consumption were plotted over the city map providing a compact overview to the providers for energy utilization analysis."
