Deep learning and computer vision algorithms can deliver highly accurate and automated interpretation of medical imaging to augment and assist clinicians. However medical imaging presents uniquely pertinent obstacles such as a lack of accessible data or a high-cost of annotation. To address this we developed data-efficient deep learning classifiers for prediction tasks in cardiology. Using pipeline supervised models to focus relevant structures we achieve an accuracy of 94.4% for 15-view still-image echocardiographic view classification and 91.2% accuracy for binary left ventricular hypertrophy classification. We then develop semi-supervised generative adversarial network models that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in a generalizable fashion. We achieve greater than 80% accuracy in view classification with only 4% of labeled data used in solely supervised techniques and achieve 92.3% accuracy for left ventricular hypertrophy classification. In exploring trade-offs between model type resolution data resources and performance we present a comprehensive analysis and improvements of efficient deep learning solutions for medical imaging assessment especially in cardiology.
