"Pediatric sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome SAHS is a highly prevalent breathing disorder that is related to many negative consequences for the childrens health and quality of life when it remains untreated. The gold standard for pediatric SAHS diagnosis overnight polysomnography has several limitations which has led to the search for alternative tests. In this sense automated analysis of overnight oximetry has emerged as a simplified technique. Previous studies have focused on the extraction of ad-hoc features from the blood oxygen saturation SpO2 signal which may miss useful information related to apnea and hypopnea AH events. In order to overcome this limitation of traditional approaches we propose the use of convolutional neural networks CNN a deep learning technique to automatically detect AH events from the SpO2 raw data. CHAT-baseline dataset composed of 453 SpO2 recordings was used for this purpose. A CNN model was trained using 60-s segments from the SpO2 signal using a training set 50% of subjects. Optimum hyperparameters of the CNN architecture were obtained using a validation set 25% of subjects. This model was applied to a third test set 25% of subjects reaching 93.6% accuracy to detect AH events. These results suggest that the application of CNN may be useful to detect changes produced in the oximetry signal by AH events in pediatric SAHS patients."
