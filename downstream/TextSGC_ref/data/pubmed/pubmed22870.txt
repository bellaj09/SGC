A Brain-Machine interface BMI allows for direct communication between the brain and machines. Neural probes for recording neural signals are among the essential components of a BMI system. In this report we review research regarding implantable neural probes and their applications to BMIs. We first discuss conventional neural probes such as the tetrode Utah array Michigan probe and electroencephalography ECoG following which we cover advancements in next-generation neural probes. These next-generation probes are associated with improvements in electrical properties mechanical durability biocompatibility and offer a high degree of freedom in practical settings. Specifically we focus on three key topics: 1 novel implantable neural probes that decrease the level of invasiveness without sacrificing performance 2 multi-modal neural probes that measure both electrical and optical signals 3 and neural probes developed using advanced materials. Because safety and precision are critical for practical applications of BMI systems future studies should aim to enhance these properties when developing next-generation neural probes.
