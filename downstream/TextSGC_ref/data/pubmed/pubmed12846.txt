Over 26 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure annually. When the cause of heart failure cannot be identified endomyocardial biopsy EMB represents the gold-standard for the evaluation of disease. However manual EMB interpretation has high inter-rater variability. Deep convolutional neural networks CNNs have been successfully applied to detect cancer diabetic retinopathy and dermatologic lesions from images. In this study we develop a CNN classifier to detect clinical heart failure from H&E stained whole-slide images from a total of 209 patients 104 patients were used for training and the remaining 105 patients for independent testing. The CNN was able to identify patients with heart failure or severe pathology with a 99% sensitivity and 94% specificity on the test set outperforming conventional feature-engineering approaches. Importantly the CNN outperformed two expert pathologists by nearly 20%. Our results suggest that deep learning analytics of EMB can be used to predict cardiac outcome. A deep-learning classifier identifies patients with clinical heart failure using whole-slide images of H&E tissue.
