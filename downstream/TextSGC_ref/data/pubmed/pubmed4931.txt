The basic organization principles of the primary visual cortex V1 are commonly assumed to also hold in the association cortex such that neurons within a cortical column share functional connectivity patterns and represent the same region of the visual field. We mapped the visual receptive fields RFs of neurons recorded at the same electrode in the ventral intraparietal area VIP and the lateral prefrontal cortex PFC of rhesus monkeys. We report that the spatial characteristics of visual RFs between adjacent neurons differed considerably with increasing heterogeneity from VIP to PFC. In addition to RF incongruences we found differential functional connectivity between putative inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal cells in PFC and VIP. These findings suggest that local RF topography vanishes with hierarchical distance from visual cortical input and argue for increasingly modified functional microcircuits in noncanonical association cortices that contrast V1.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our visual field is thought to be represented faithfully by the early visual brain areas; all the information from a certain region of the visual field is conveyed to neurons situated close together within a functionally defined cortical column. We examined this principle in the association areas PFC and ventral intraparietal area of rhesus monkeys and found that adjacent neurons represent markedly different areas of the visual field. This is the first demonstration of such noncanonical organization of these brain areas.
