Wireless sensor networks are required in smart applications to provide accurate control where the high density of sensors brings in a large quantity of redundant data. In order to reduce the waste of limited network resources data aggregation is utilized to avoid redundancy forwarding. However most of aggregation schemes reduce information accuracy and prolong end-to-end delay when eliminating transmission overhead. In this paper we propose a data aggregation scheme based on overlapping rate of sensing area namely AggOR aiming for energy-efficient data collection in wireless sensor networks with high information accuracy. According to aggregation rules gathering nodes are selected from candidate parent nodes and appropriate neighbor nodes considering a preset threshold of overlapping rate of sensing area. Therefore the collected data in a gathering area are highly correlated and a large amount of redundant data could be cleaned. Meanwhile AggOR keeps the original entropy by only deleting the duplicated data. Experiment results show that compared with others AggOR has a high data accuracy and a short end-to-end delay with a similar network lifetime.
