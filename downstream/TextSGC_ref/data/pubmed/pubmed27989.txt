Increasing command generation rate of an event-related potential-based brain-robot system is challenging because of limited information transfer rate of a brain-computer interface system. To improve the rate we propose a dual stimuli approach that is flashing a robot image and is scanning another robot image simultaneously. Two kinds of event-related potentials N200 and P300 potentials evoked in this dual stimuli condition are decoded by a convolutional neural network. Compared with the traditional approaches this proposed approach significantly improves the online information transfer rate from 23.0 or 17.8 to 39.1 bits/min at an accuracy of 91.7%. These results suggest that combining multiple types of stimuli to evoke distinguishable ERPs might be a promising direction to improve the command generation rate in the brain-computer interface.
