Prostate cancer represents today the most typical example of a pathology whose diagnosis requires multiparametric imaging a strategy where multiple imaging techniques are combined to reach an acceptable diagnostic performance. However the reviewing weighing and coupling of multiple images not only places additional burden on the radiologist it also complicates the reviewing process. Prostate cancer imaging has therefore been an important target for the development of computer-aided diagnostic CAD tools. In this survey we discuss the advances in CAD for prostate cancer over the last decades with special attention to the deep-learning techniques that have been designed in the last few years. Moreover we elaborate and compare the methods employed to deliver the CAD output to the operator for further medical decision making. Artificial intelligence in multiparametric prostate cancer imaging with focus on deep-learning methods.
