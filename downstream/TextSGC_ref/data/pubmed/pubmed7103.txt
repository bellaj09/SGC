Recent advances in the unsupervised and generative models of deep learning have shown promise for application in biomedical signal processing. In this work we present a portable resource-constrained ultrasound US system trained using Variational Autoencoder VAE network which performs compressive-sensing on pre-beamformed RF signals. The encoder network compresses the RF data which is further transmitted to the cloud. At the cloud the decoder reconstructs back the ultrasound image which can be used for inferencing. The compression is done with an undersampling ratio of 1/2 1/3 1/5 and 1/10 without significant loss of the resolution. We also compared the model by state-of-the-art compressive-sensing reconstruction algorithm and it shows significant improvement in terms of PSNR and MSE. The innovation in this approach resides in training with binary weights at the encoder shows its feasibility for the hardware implementation at the edge. In the future we plan to include our field-programmable gate array FPGA based design directly interfaced with sensors for real-time analysis of Ultrasound images during medical procedures.
