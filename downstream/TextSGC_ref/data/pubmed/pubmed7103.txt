Major depressive disorder MDD and anxiety disorders are highly co-morbid. Research has shown conflicting evidence for white matter alteration and amygdala volume reduction in mood and anxiety disorders. To date no studies have examined differences in structural connectivity between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. This study compared fractional anisotropy FA and density of selected white matter tracts and amygdala volume between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. A comparison of structural connectivity in anxious depression versus non-anxious depression.
