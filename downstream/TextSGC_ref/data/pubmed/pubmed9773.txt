Traditional radiomics models mainly rely on explicitly-designed handcrafted features from medical images. This paper aimed to investigate if deep features extracted via transfer learning can generate radiomics signatures for prediction of overall survival OS in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme GBM. This study comprised a discovery data set of 75 patients and an independent validation data set of 37 patients. A total of 1403 handcrafted features and 98304 deep features were extracted from preoperative multi-modality MR images. After feature selection a six-deep-feature signature was constructed by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator LASSO Cox regression model. A radiomics nomogram was further presented by combining the signature and clinical risk factors such as age and Karnofsky Performance Score. Compared with traditional risk factors the proposed signature achieved better performance for prediction of OS C-index\u2009=\u20090.710 95% CI: 0.588 0.932 and significant stratification of patients into prognostically distinct groups P\u2009<\u20090.001 HR\u2009=\u20095.128 95% CI: 2.029 12.960. The combined model achieved improved predictive performance C-index\u2009=\u20090.739. Our study demonstrates that transfer learning-based deep features are able to generate prognostic imaging signature for OS prediction and patient stratification for GBM indicating the potential of deep imaging feature-based biomarker in preoperative care of GBM patients.
