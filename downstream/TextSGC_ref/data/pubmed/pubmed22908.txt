A mixed reality MR headset that enables three-dimensional 3D visualization of interactive holograms anchored to specific points in physical space was developed for use with lateral skull base anatomy. The objectives of this study are to: 1 develop an augmented reality platform using the headset for visualization of temporal bone structures and 2 measure the accuracy of the platform as an image guidance system. Development of a Mixed Reality Platform for Lateral Skull Base Anatomy.
