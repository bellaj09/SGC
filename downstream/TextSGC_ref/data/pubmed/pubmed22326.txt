"Immersive navigation in virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR leverages physical locomotion through pose tracking of the head-mounted display. While this navigation modality is intuitive regions of interest in the scene may suffer from occlusion and require significant viewpoint translation. Moreover limited physical space and user mobility need to be taken into consideration. Some regions of interest may require viewpoints that are physically unreachable without less intuitive methods such as walking in-place or redirected walking. We propose a novel approach for increasing navigation efficiency in VR and AR using multiperspective visualization. Our approach samples occluded regions of interest from additional perspectives which are integrated seamlessly into the users perspective. This approach improves navigation efficiency by bringing simultaneously into view multiple regions of interest allowing the user to explore more while moving less. We have conducted a user study that shows that our method brings significant performance improvement in VR and AR environments on tasks that include tracking matching searching and ambushing objects of interest."
