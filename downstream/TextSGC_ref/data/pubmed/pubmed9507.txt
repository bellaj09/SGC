"In this study we proposed a new method for multi-class classification of sleep apnea/hypopnea events based on a long short-term memory LSTM using photoplethysmography PPG signals. The three-layer LSTM model was used with batch-normalization and dropout to classify the multi-class events including normal apnea and hypopnea. The PPG signals which were measured by the nocturnal polysomnography with 7\xa0h from 82 patients suffered from sleep apnea were used to model training and evaluation. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on the training set from 63 patients and test set from 13 patients. The results of the LSTM model showed the following high performances: the positive predictive value of 94.16% for normal 81.38% for apnea and 97.92% for hypopnea; sensitivity of 86.03% for normal 91.24% for apnea and 99.38% for hypopnea events. The proposed method had especially higher performance of hypopnea classification which had been a drawback of previous studies. Furthermore it can be applied to a system that can classify sleep apnea/hypopnea and normal events automatically without experts intervention at home."
