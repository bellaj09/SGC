Brain-computer interfaces represent a range of acknowledged technologies that translate brain activity into computer commands. The aim of our research is to develop and evaluate a BCI control application for certain assistive technologies that can be used for remote telepresence or remote driving. The communication channel to the target device is based on the steady-state visual evoked potentials. In order to test the control application a mobile robotic car MRC was introduced and a four-class BCI graphical user interface with live video feedback and stimulation boxes on the same screen for piloting the MRC was designed. For the purpose of evaluating a potential real-life scenario for such assistive technology we present a study where 61 subjects steered the MRC through a predetermined route. All 61 subjects were able to control the MRC and finish the experiment mean time 207.08\u2009s SD 50.25 with a mean SD accuracy and ITR of 93.03% 5.73 and 14.07\u2009bits/min 4.44 respectively. The results show that our proposed SSVEP-based BCI control application is suitable for mobile robots with a shared-control approach. We also did not observe any negative influence of the simultaneous live video feedback and SSVEP stimulation on the performance of the BCI system.
