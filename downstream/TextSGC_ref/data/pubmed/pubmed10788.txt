The visual inspection of massive civil infrastructure is a common trend for maintaining its reliability and structural health. However this procedure which uses human inspectors requires long inspection times and relies on the subjective and empirical knowledge of the inspectors. To address these limitations a machine vision-based autonomous crack detection method is proposed using a deep convolutional neural network DCNN technique. It consists of a fully convolutional neural network FCN with an encoder and decoder framework for semantic segmentation which performs pixel-wise classification to accurately detect cracks. The main idea is to capture the global context of a scene and determine whether cracks are in the image while also providing a reduced and essential picture of the crack locations. The visual geometry group network VGGNet a variant of the DCCN is employed as a backbone in the proposed FCN for end-to-end training. The efficacy of the proposed FCN method is tested on a publicly available benchmark dataset of concrete crack images. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is highly effective for concrete crack classification obtaining scores of approximately 92% for both the recall and F1 average.
