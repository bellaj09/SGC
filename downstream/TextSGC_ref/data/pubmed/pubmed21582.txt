Driving is a vision-based activity of daily living that impacts safety. Because visual disruption can compromise driving safety contact lens wearers with astigmatism may pose a driving safety risk if they experience residual blur from spherical lenses that do not correct their astigmatism or if they experience blur from toric lenses that rotate excessively. Given that toric lens stabilization systems are continually improving this preliminary study tested the hypothesis that astigmats wearing toric contact lenses compared with spherical lenses would exhibit better overall driving performance and driving-specific visual abilities. Does correcting astigmatism with toric lenses improve driving performance?
