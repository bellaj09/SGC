Mental health issues are widely accepted as one of the most prominent health challenges in the world with over 300 million people currently suffering from depression alone. With massive volumes of user-generated data on social networking platforms researchers are increasingly using machine learning to determine whether this content can be used to detect mental health problems in users. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to classify users with depression via multiple instance learning which can learn from user-level labels to identify post-level labels. By combining every possibility of posts label category it can generate temporal posting profiles which can then be used to classify users with depression. This paper shows that there are clear differences in posting patterns between users with depression and non-depression which is represented through the combined likelihood of posts label category.
