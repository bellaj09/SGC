Evolved living beings can anticipate the consequences of their actions in complex multilevel dynamic situations. This ability relies on abstracting the meaning of an action. The underlying brain mechanisms of such semantic processing of information are poorly understood. Here we show how our novel concept known as time compaction provides a natural way of representing semantic knowledge of actions in time-changing situations. As a testbed we model a fencing scenario with a subject deciding between attack and defense strategies. The semantic content of each action in terms of lethality versatility and imminence is then structured as a spatial static map representing a particular fencing dynamic situation. The model allows deploying a variety of cognitive strategies in a fast and reliable way. We validate the approach in virtual reality and by using a real humanoid robot.
