To detect attributes of medical concepts in clinical text a traditional method often consists of two steps: named entity recognition of attributes and then relation classification between medical concepts and attributes. Here we present a novel solution in which attribute detection of given concepts is converted into a sequence labeling problem thus attribute entity recognition and relation classification are done simultaneously within one step. Applying a deep learning-based sequence labeling approach to detect attributes of medical concepts in clinical text.
