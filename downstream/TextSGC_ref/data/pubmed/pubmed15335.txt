We introduce HD or &#x201C;Hierarchical-Deep&#x201D; models a new compositional learning architecture that integrates deep learning models with structured hierarchical Bayesian HB models. Specifically we show how we can learn a hierarchical Dirichlet process HDP prior over the activities of the top-level features in a deep Boltzmann machine DBM. This compound HDP-DBM model learns to learn novel concepts from very few training example by learning low-level generic features high-level features that capture correlations among low-level features and a category hierarchy for sharing priors over the high-level features that are typical of different kinds of concepts. We present efficient learning and inference algorithms for the HDP-DBM model and show that it is able to learn new concepts from very few examples on CIFAR-100 object recognition handwritten character recognition and human motion capture datasets. Learning with hierarchical-deep models.
