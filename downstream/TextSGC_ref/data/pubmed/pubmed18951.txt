"Because critical illness survivors frequently experience several long-term psychological impairments altering quality of life after ICU there is a trend towards increasing follow-up care mainly via ICU follow-up clinics. Despite these and other initiatives understanding of patients post-ICU needs to help them cope with their problems and subsequently improve quality of life is largely lacking. Our aim was therefore to assess the needs expectations and wishes in ICU survivors to receive information with the purpose to help them better grasp ICU treatment. In addition we assessed the perceived burden of psychological trauma after ICU treatment and the health-related quality of life HRQoL up to 2.5\u2009years after ICU discharge." Patients suffering from psychological impairments following critical illness are in need of information.
