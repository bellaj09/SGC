"Histopathological whole slide images of haematoxylin and eosin H&E-stained biopsies contain valuable information with relation to cancer disease and its clinical outcomes. Still there are no highly accurate automated methods to correlate histolopathological images with brain cancer patients survival which can help in scheduling patients therapeutic treatment and allocate time for preclinical studies to guide personalized treatments. We now propose a new classifier namely DeepSurvNet powered by deep convolutional neural networks to accurately classify in 4 classes brain cancer patients survival rate based on histopathological images class I 0-6\xa0months; class II 6-12\xa0months; class III 12-24\xa0months; and class IV >24\xa0months survival after diagnosis. After training and testing of DeepSurvNet model on a public brain cancer dataset The Cancer Genome Atlas we have generalized it using independent testing on unseen samples. Using DeepSurvNet we obtained precisions of 0.99 and 0.8 in the testing phases on the mentioned datasets respectively which shows DeepSurvNet is a reliable classifier for brain cancer patients survival rate classification based on histopathological images. Finally analysis of the frequency of mutations revealed differences in terms of frequency and type of genes associated to each class supporting the idea of a different genetic fingerprint associated to patient survival. We conclude that DeepSurvNet constitutes a new artificial intelligence tool to assess the survival rate in brain cancer.
