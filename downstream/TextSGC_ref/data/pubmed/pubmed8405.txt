"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus STN provides an effective treatment for Parkinsons disease PD motor symptoms. However findings of effects on cognitive function such as feedback learning remain controversial and rare. The aim of the present study was to gain a better understanding of cognitive alterations associated with STN-DBS. Therefore we investigated effects of STN-DBS on active and observational feedback learning in PD. 18 PD patients with STN-DBS and 18 matched healthy controls completed active and observational feedback learning tasks. Patients were investigated ON and OFF STN-DBS. Tasks consisted of learning with feedback and test phases without feedback. STN-DBS improved active learning during feedback trials and PD patients ON but not OFF STN-DBS showed comparable performance patterns as healthy controls. No STN-DBS effect was found when assessing performance during active test trials without feedback. In this case however STN-DBS effects were found to depend on symptom severity. While more impaired patients benefited from STN-DBS stimulation had no facilitating effect on patients with less severe symptoms. Along similar lines the severity of motor symptoms tended to be significantly correlated with differences in active test performance due to STN-DBS. For observational feedback learning there was a tendency for a positive STN-DBS effect with patients reaching the performance level of healthy controls only ON STN-DBS. The present data suggest that STN-DBS facilitates active feedback learning in PD patients. Furthermore they provide first evidence that STN-DBS might not only affect learning from own but also from observed actions and outcomes."
