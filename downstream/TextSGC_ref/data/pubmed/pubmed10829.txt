The explosion of medical imaging data along with the advent of big data analytics has launched an exciting era for clinical research. One factor affecting the ability to aggregate large medical image collections for research is the lack of infrastructure for automated data annotation. Among all imaging modalities annotation of magnetic resonance MR images is particularly challenging due to the non-standard labeling of MR image types. In this work we aimed to train a deep neural network to annotate MR image sequence type for scans of brain tumor patients. We focused on the four most common MR sequence types within neuroimaging: T1-weighted T1W T1-weighted post-gadolinium contrast T1Gd T2-weighted T2W and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR. Our repository contains images acquired using a variety of pulse sequences sequence parameters field strengths and scanner manufacturers. Image selection was agnostic to patient demographics diagnosis and the presence of tumor in the imaging field of view. We used a total of 14400 two-dimensional images each visualizing a different part of the brain. Data was split into train validation and test sets 9600 2400 and 2400 images respectively and sets consisted of equal-sized groups of image types. Overall the model reached an accuracy of 99% on the test set. Our results showed excellent performance of deep learning techniques in predicting sequence types for brain tumor MR images. We conclude deep learning models can serve as tools to support clinical research and facilitate efficient database management.
