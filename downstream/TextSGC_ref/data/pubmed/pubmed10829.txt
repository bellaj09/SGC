VPS35-related Parkinson disease VPS35-PD is defined as Parkinson disease caused by heterozygous VPS35 pathogenic variants. Currently the only known VPS35 variant with confirmed pathogenicity is c.1858G>A p.Asp620Asn. Except for a younger age of onset VPS35-PD is clinically indistinguishable from Parkinson disease of unknown cause so-called sporadic Parkinson disease. Variability among 50 individuals reported with molecularly confirmed VPS35-PD includes age of onset mean: 51.08.7 years; range: 34-68 years Parkinson subtype tremor akinetic rigid mixed first motor symptom course of the disease unilateral onset and slow disease progression are typical; dyskinesia and motor fluctuations may occur and presence/absence of neuropsychiatric manifestations including depression schizophrenia learning difficulties mild cognitive impairment and dementia.
