Resection of gliomas invading primary motor cortex and subcortical motor pathway is difficult in both surgical decision-making and functional outcome prediction. In this study magnetic resonance MR diffusion tensor imaging DTI data were used to perform tractography to visualize pyramidal tract PT along its whole length in a stereoscopic virtual reality VR environment. The potential value of its clinical application was evaluated. Virtual reality presurgical planning for cerebral gliomas adjacent to motor pathways in an integrated 3-D stereoscopic visualization of structural MRI and DTI tractography.
