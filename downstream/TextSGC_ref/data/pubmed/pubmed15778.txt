"Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the knee is the preferred method for diagnosing knee injuries. However interpretation of knee MRI is time-intensive and subject to diagnostic error and variability. An automated system for interpreting knee MRI could prioritize high-risk patients and assist clinicians in making diagnoses. Deep learning methods in being able to automatically learn layers of features are well suited for modeling the complex relationships between medical images and their interpretations. In this study we developed a deep learning model for detecting general abnormalities and specific diagnoses anterior cruciate ligament ACL tears and meniscal tears on knee MRI exams. We then measured the effect of providing the models predictions to clinical experts during interpretation."
