"In this work the effects of using immersive media such as virtual reality on the performance of training programs to avoid ergonomics risks are analyzed. The advance of technology has made it possible to use low-cost portable devices able to generate highly immersive experiences in training programs. The effects of using this kind of device in training programs have been studied in several fields such as industrial security medicine and surgery rehabilitation or construction. However there is very little research on the effects of using immersive media in training workers to avoid ergonomics risk factors. In this study we compare the effects of using traditional and immersive media in a training program to avoid three common ergonomics risk factors in industrial environments. Our results showed that using immersive media increases the participants engagement during the training. In the same way the learning contents are perceived as more interesting and useful and are better remembered over time leading to an increased perception of the ergonomics risks among workers. However we found that little training was finally transferred to the workplace three months after the training session."
