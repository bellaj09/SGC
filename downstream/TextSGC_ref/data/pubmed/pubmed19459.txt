Timely feedback on surgical technique is an important aspect of surgical skill training in any learning environment be it virtual or otherwise. Feedback on technique should be provided in real-time to allow trainees to recognize and amend their errors as they occur. Expert surgeons have typically carried out this task but they have limited time available to spend with trainees. Virtual reality surgical simulators offer effective repeatable training at relatively low cost but their benefits may not be fully realized while they still require the presence of experts to provide feedback. We attempt to overcome this limitation by introducing a real-time feedback system for surgical technique within a temporal bone surgical simulator. Our evaluation study shows that this feedback system performs exceptionally well with respect to accuracy and effectiveness.
