"The present study investigated the neuropsychological effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation DBS on subthalamic nucleus STN in Chinese-Cantonese patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease PD. Twenty-seven patients were prospectively recruited from the Movement Disorder Clinic at the Hong Kong Prince of Wales Hospital. Neuropsychological evaluations were performed at baseline 6 and 12 months following the DBS procedure. Assessment battery included standardized tests on global cognitive function verbal memory non-verbal memory confrontation naming visuospatial organization attention and executive functions. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured by two self-reported questionnaires. Results demonstrated diminished performance on a category fluency task that occurred at 6 months post-operatively and persisted at 12-month re-evaluation; 29.6-33.3 % of patients showed reduction of more than 1 SD standard deviation at post-operative measure. Conversely performance on an immediate recall task in a verbal memory test was found to improve significantly at the same time point and persisted through 12 months after surgery; 22.2-25.9 % showed an improvement 1 SD. Psychologically anxiety symptoms were statistically decreased and the significant reduction occurred at 12 months after surgery. Patients who reported a moderate to severe level of anxiety reduced from 51.9 to 18.5 %. Our findings concurred with most evidences on the effects of STN-DBS on verbal fluency; on the other hand we demonstrated improvement of immediate verbal memory that warranted further investigation."
