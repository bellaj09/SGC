"Virtual Reality VR entered the mental health field some years ago. While the technology itself has been available for more than ten years now there is still a certain amount of uncertainty among researchers and users as to whether VR will one day fulfill all its promises. In this chapter we are giving an overview of the implementation of the technology in our mental health research facility in Basel Switzerland. The development of two applications for use with claustrophobic and acrophobic patients perspectively serves just as an example within this context. Some may say the chapter is too much based on technical considerations. Strictly speaking VR is pure technology even knowing that this special form of technology has sensory psychological and even philosophical implications not known from other human computer interfaces so far. As far as we are concerned the development of the technology for use within the mental health sector has merely just begun. As todays mostly used immersive output devices Head-mounted Displays shutter glasses do not have a satisfactory resolution do restrict movements and prevent multi-user-capabilities there will be a soar of mental health applications the day some or at least the most important of these obstacles have been overcome." From toy to tool: the development of immersive virtual reality environments for psychotherapy of specific phobias.
