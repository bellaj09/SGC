The current study investigated whether gradually reducing the frequency of aversive stimuli during extinction can prevent the return of fear. Thirty-one participants of a three-stage procedure acquisition extinction and a reinstatement test on day 2 were randomly assigned to a standard extinction SE and gradual extinction GE procedure. The two groups differed only in the extinction procedure. While the SE group ran through a regular extinction process without any negative events the frequency of the aversive stimuli during the extinction phase was gradually reduced for the GE group. The unconditioned stimulus US was an air blast 5 bar 10 ms. A spider and a scorpion were used as conditioned stimuli CS. The outcome variables were contingency ratings and physiological measures skin conductance response SCR and startle response. There were no differences found between the two groups for the acquisition and extinction phases concerning contingency ratings SCR or startle response. GE compared to SE significantly reduced the return of fear in the reinstatement test for the startle response but not for SCR or contingency ratings. This study was successful in translating the findings in rodent to humans. The results suggest that the GE process is suitable for increasing the efficacy of fear extinction. Gradual extinction reduces reinstatement.
