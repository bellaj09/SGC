Source-reconstructed magneto- and electroencephalography M/EEG are promising tools for investigating the human functional connectome. To reduce data decrease noise and obtain results directly comparable to magnetic resonance imaging MRI M/EEG source data can be collapsed into a cortical parcellation. For most collapsing approaches however it remains unclear if collapsed parcel time series accurately represent the coherent source dynamics within each parcel. Sparse weightings for collapsing inverse solutions to cortical parcellations optimize M/EEG source reconstruction accuracy.
