"Using virtual reality VR to examine risky behavior that is mediated by interpersonal contact such as agreeing to have sex drink or smoke with someone offers particular promise and challenges. Social contextual stimuli that might trigger impulsive responses can be carefully controlled in virtual environments VE and yet manipulations of risk might be implausible to participants if they do not feel sufficiently immersed in the environment. The current study examined whether individuals can display adequate evidence of presence in a VE that involved potential interpersonally-induced risk: meeting a potential dating partner. Results offered some evidence for the potential of VR for the study of such interpersonal risk situations. Participants reaction to the scenario and risk-associated responses to the situation suggested that the embodied nature of virtual reality override the reality of the risks impossibility allowing participants to experience adequate situational embedding or presence."
