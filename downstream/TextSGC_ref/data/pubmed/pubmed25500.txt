Cervical kinematics have functional relevance and are important for assessment and management in patients with neck disorders. A better understanding of factors that might influence cervical kinematics is required. The aim of this study was to determine any relationships between altered kinematics to the symptoms and signs of sensorimotor impairments neck pain and disability and fear of neck motion in people with neck pain. Factors associated with cervical kinematic impairments in patients with neck pain.
