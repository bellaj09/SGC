Ankle sprains are the most common sport related injuries. An alternative to physical therapy in the treatment of ankle sprains is home based exercise therapy. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of Wii Fit exercise therapy in ankle sprain patients on temporal-spatial and kinematic gait parameters with a conventional therapy and b a control group not receiving exercise therapy. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to a Wii Fit physical therapy or control group. Temporal-spatial and kinematic gait parameters were assessed at baseline 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up. All groups improved gait speed cadence and step length between baseline and 6-week follow-up P<0.036. Single support time improved only in the Wii Fit group P<0.001. Symmetry index of the single support time improved in the Wii Fit group and physical therapy group P<0.048. No between-group differences were found for temporal-spatial gait parameters P>0.050. Maximum plantar flexion improved in the physical therapy and control group between baseline and 6-week follow-up P<0.035. However none of the groups improved dorsiflexion P>0.050. In conclusion an unsupervised home-based 6-week Wii Fit exercise therapy can be applied in ankle sprain patients. However it was not more effective compared to physical therapy or no exercise therapy at all.
