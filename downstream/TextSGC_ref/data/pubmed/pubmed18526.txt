Trials of virtual reality exposure therapy VRET for anxiety-related disorders have proliferated in number and diversity since our previous meta-analysis that examined 13 total trials most of which were for specific phobias Powers & Emmelkamp 2008. Since then new trials have compared VRET to more diverse anxiety and related disorders including social anxiety disorder SAD posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD and panic disorder PD with and without agoraphobia. With the availability of this data it is imperative to re-examine the efficacy of VRET for anxiety. A literature search for randomized controlled trials of VRET versus control or in vivo exposure yielded 30 studies with 1057 participants. Fourteen studies tested VRET for specific phobias 8 for SAD or performance anxiety 5 for PTSD and 3 for PD. A random effects analysis estimated a large effect size for VRET versus waitlist g\u2009=\u20090.90 and a medium to large effect size for VRET versus psychological placebo conditions g\u2009=\u20090.78. A comparison of VRET and in vivo conditions did not show significantly different effect sizes g\u2009=\u2009-0.07. These findings were relatively consistent across disorders. A meta-regression analysis revealed that larger sample sizes were associated with lower effect sizes in VRET versus control comparisons \u2009=\u2009-0.007 p\u2009<\u2009 0.05. These results indicate that VRET is an effective and equal medium for exposure therapy.
