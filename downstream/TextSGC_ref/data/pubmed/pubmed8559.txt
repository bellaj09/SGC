The promoter region is located near the transcription start sites and regulates transcription initiation of the gene by controlling the binding of RNA polymerase. Thus promoter region recognition is an important area of interest in the field of bioinformatics. Numerous tools for promoter prediction were proposed. However the reliability of these tools still needs to be improved. In this work we propose a robust deep learning model called DeePromoter to analyze the characteristics of the short eukaryotic promoter sequences and accurately recognize the human and mouse promoter sequences. DeePromoter combines a convolutional neural network CNN and a long short-term memory LSTM. Additionally instead of using non-promoter regions of the genome as a negative set we derive a more challenging negative set from the promoter sequences. The proposed negative set reconstruction method improves the discrimination ability and significantly reduces the number of false positive predictions. Consequently DeePromoter outperforms the previously proposed promoter prediction tools. In addition a web-server for promoter prediction is developed based on the proposed methods and made available at https://home.jbnu.ac.kr/NSCL/deepromoter.htm.
