Amongst social contextual influences on pain the manner in which pain and painful procedures are communicated to patients is considered an important contributor to the subjective experience of pain. Threatening information e.g. by the use of technical language is suggested to increase pain reports. Validation or communicating understanding towards another person reporting personal experiences is suggested to reduce pain. The current study examines effects of both information language technical vs. plain language and validation validation vs. invalidation on the subjective experience of experimentally induced pain. Effects of invalidation and plain versus technical language on the experience of experimentally induced pain: A computer controlled simulation paradigm.
