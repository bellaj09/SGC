"Augmented reality AR has great potential in education training and surgical guidance in the medical field. Its combination with three-dimensional 3D printing 3DP opens new possibilities in clinical applications. Although these technologies have grown exponentially in recent years their adoption by physicians is still limited since they require extensive knowledge of engineering and software development. Therefore the purpose of this protocol is to describe a step-by-step methodology enabling inexperienced users to create a smartphone app which combines AR and 3DP for the visualization of anatomical 3D models of patients with a 3D-printed reference marker. The protocol describes how to create 3D virtual models of a patients anatomy derived from 3D medical images. It then explains how to perform positioning of the 3D models with respect to marker references. Also provided are instructions for how to 3D print the required tools and models. Finally steps to deploy the app are provided. The protocol is based on free and multi-platform software and can be applied to any medical imaging modality or patient. An alternative approach is described to provide automatic registration between a 3D-printed model created from a patients anatomy and the projected holograms. As an example a clinical case of a patient suffering from distal leg sarcoma is provided to illustrate the methodology. It is expected that this protocol will accelerate the adoption of AR and 3DP technologies by medical professionals."
