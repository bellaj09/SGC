Although rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality have become relatively low in patients undergoing transnasal transsphenoidal surgery TSS for pituitary adenoma cerebrospinal fluid CSF fistulas remain a major driver of postoperative morbidity. Persistent CSF fistulas harbor the potential for headache and meningitis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether neural network-based models can reliably identify patients at high risk for intraoperative CSF leakage. Neural network-based identification of patients at high risk for intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks in endoscopic pituitary surgery.
