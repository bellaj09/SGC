Stereoscopic video recordings of operative microscopy during neuroanatomic dissections are an important component of surgical training and research in well-financed medical schools and teaching hospitals. However the high cost of the latest operative microscopes with integrated video recording equipment can be a limiting factor in their worldwide use. The aim of the present work is to provide a simple low-cost 3-dimensional 3D stereoscopic operative microscope recording system that can be used even in economically and resource-limited locations. This is achieved by using readily available smartphones smartphone accessories and computer software.
