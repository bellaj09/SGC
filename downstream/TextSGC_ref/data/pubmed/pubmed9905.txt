The accurate severity classification of a bug report is an important aspect of bug fixing. The bug reports are submitted into the bug tracking system with high speed and owing to this bug repository size has been increasing at an enormous rate. This increased bug repository size introduces biases in the bug triage process. Therefore it is necessary to classify the severity of a bug report to balance the bug triaging process. Previously many machine learning models were proposed for automation of bug severity classification. The accuracy of these models is not up to the mark because they do not extract the important feature patterns for learning the classifier. This paper proposes a novel deep learning model for multiclass severity classification called Bug Severity classification to address these challenges by using a Convolutional Neural Network and Random forest with Boosting BCR. This model directly learns the latent and highly representative features. Initially the natural language techniques preprocess the bug report text and then n-gram is used to extract the features. Further the Convolutional Neural Network extracts the important feature patterns of respective severity classes. Lastly the random forest with boosting classifies the multiple bug severity classes. The average accuracy of the proposed model is 96.34% on multiclass severity of five open source projects. The average F-measures of the proposed BCR and the existing approach were 96.43% and 84.24% respectively on binary class severity classification. The results prove that the proposed BCR approach enhances the performance of bug severity classification over the state-of-the-art techniques.
