Unilateral peripheral vestibular loss results in gait and balance impairment dizziness and oscillopsia. Vestibular rehabilitation benefits patients but optimal treatment remains unknown. Virtual reality is an emerging tool in rehabilitation and provides opportunities to improve both outcomes and patient satisfaction with treatment. The Nintendo Wii Fit Plus NWFP is a low cost virtual reality system that challenges balance and provides visual and auditory feedback. It may augment the motor learning that is required to improve balance and gait but no trials to date have investigated efficacy. Effectiveness of conventional versus virtual reality based vestibular rehabilitation in the treatment of dizziness gait and balance impairment in adults with unilateral peripheral vestibular loss: a randomised controlled trial.
