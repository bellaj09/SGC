Preoperative identification of knee arthroplasty is important for planning revision surgery. However up to 10% of implants are not identified prior to surgery. The purposes of this study were to develop and test the performance of a deep learning system DLS for the automated radiographic 1 identification of the presence or absence of a total knee arthroplasty TKA; 2 classification of TKA vs. unicompartmental knee arthroplasty UKA; and 3 differentiation between two different primary TKA models. Automated detection & classification of knee arthroplasty using deep learning.
