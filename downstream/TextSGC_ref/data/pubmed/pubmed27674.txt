"MUNDUS is an assistive framework for recovering direct interaction capability of severely motor impaired people based on arm reaching and hand functions. It aims at achieving personalization modularity and maximization of the users direct involvement in assistive systems. To this MUNDUS exploits any residual control of the end-user and can be adapted to the level of severity or to the progression of the disease allowing the user to voluntarily interact with the environment. MUNDUS target pathologies are high-level spinal cord injury SCI and neurodegenerative and genetic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Friedreich ataxia and multiple sclerosis MS. The system can be alternatively driven by residual voluntary muscular activation head/eye motion and brain signals. MUNDUS modularly combines an antigravity lightweight and non-cumbersome exoskeleton closed-loop controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for arm and hand motion and potentially a motorized hand orthosis for grasping interactive objects."
