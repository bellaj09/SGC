Seizures have traditionally been considered hypersynchronous excitatory events and epilepsy has been separated into focal and generalized epilepsy based largely on the spatial distribution of brain regions involved at seizure onset. Epilepsy however is increasingly recognized as a complex network disorder that may be distributed and dynamic. Responsive neurostimulation RNS is a recent technology that utilizes intracranial electroencephalography EEG to detect seizures and delivers stimulation to cortical and subcortical brain structures for seizure control. RNS has particular significance in the clinical treatment of medically refractory epilepsy and brain-computer interfaces in epilepsy. Closed loop RNS represents an important step forward to understand and target nodes in the seizure network. The thalamus is a central network node within several functional networks and regulates input to the cortex; clinically several thalamic nuclei are safe and feasible targets. We highlight the network theory of epilepsy potential targets for neuromodulation in epilepsy and the first reported use of RNS as a first generation brain-computer interface to detect and stimulate the centromedian intralaminar thalamic nucleus in a patient with bilateral cortical onset of seizures. We propose that advances in network analysis and neuromodulatory techniques using brain-computer interfaces will significantly improve outcomes in patients with epilepsy. There are numerous avenues of future direction in brain-computer interface devices including multi-modal sensors flexible electrode arrays multi-site targeting and wireless communication.
