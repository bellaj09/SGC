This study aimed to determine the effects of a virtual reality exercise program using the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System IREX on the recovery of motor and cognitive function and the performance of activities of daily living in stroke patients. Subjects The study enrolled 10 patients diagnosed with stroke who received occupational therapy at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of Hospital A between January and March 2014. Methods The patients took part in the virtual reality exercise program for 30 minutes each day three times per week for 4 weeks. Then the patients were re-evaluated to determine changes in upper extremity function cognitive function and performance of activities of daily living 4 weeks after the baseline assessment. Results In the experimental group there were significant differences in the Korea-Mini Mental Status Evaluation Korean version of the modified Barthel index and Fugl-Meyer assessment scores between the baseline and endpoint. Conclusion The virtual reality exercise program was effective for restoring function in stroke patients. Further studies should develop systematic protocols for rehabilitation training with a virtual reality exercise program. Effects of a virtual reality-based exercise program on functional recovery in stroke patients: part 1.
