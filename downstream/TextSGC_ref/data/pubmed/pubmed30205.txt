It is well-known that motor cortical oscillatory components are modulated in their amplitude during voluntary and imagined movements. These patterns have been used to develop brain-machine interfaces BMI which focused mostly on movement kinematics. In contrast there have been only a few studies on the relation between brain oscillatory activity and the control of force in particular grasping force which is of primary importance for common daily activities. In this study we recorded intraoperative high-density electrocorticography ECoG from the sensorimotor cortex of four patients while they executed a voluntary isometric hand grasp following verbal instruction. The grasp was held for 2 to 3 s before being instructed to relax. We studied the power modulations of neural oscillations during the whole time-course of the grasp onset hold and offset phases. Phasic event-related desynchronization ERD in the low-frequency band LFB from 8 to 32 Hz and event-related synchronization ERS in the high-frequency band HFB from 60 to 200 Hz were observed at grasp onset and offset. However during the grasp holding period the magnitude of LFB-ERD and HFB-ERS decreased near or at the baseline level. Overall LFB-ERD and HFB-ERS show phasic characteristics related to the changes of grasp force onset/offset in all four patients. More precisely the fluctuations of HFB-ERS primarily and of LFB-ERD to a lesser extent correlated with the time-course of the first time-derivative of force yank rather than with force itself. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that establishes such a correlation. These results have fundamental implications for the decoding of grasp in brain oscillatory activity-based neuroprosthetics. Power Modulations of ECoG Alpha/Beta and Gamma Bands Correlate With Time-Derivative of Force During Hand Grasp.
