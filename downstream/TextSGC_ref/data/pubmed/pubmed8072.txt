Electrocardiography is the most common tool to diagnose cardiovascular diseases. Annotation segmentation and rhythm classification of ECGs are challenging tasks especially in the presence of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. Our aim is to increase the accuracy of heart rhythm estimation by the use of extreme gradient boosting trees and the development of a deep convolutional neural network for ECG segmentation. A convolutional neural network for ECG annotation as the basis for classification of cardiac rhythms.
