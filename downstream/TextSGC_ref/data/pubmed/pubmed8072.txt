In recent years deep learning models have been widely used in the field of hyperspectral imaging. However the training of deep learning models requires not only a large number of samples but also the need to set too many hyper-parameters which is time consuming and laborious for researchers. This study used hyperspectral imaging technology combined with a deep learning model suitable for small-scale sample data sets deep forests DF model to classify rice seeds with different degrees of frost damage. During the period three spectral preprocessing methods Savitzky-Golay first derivative SG1 standard normal variate SNV and multivariate scatter correction MSC were used to process the original spectral data and three feature extraction algorithms principal component analysis PCA successive projections algorithm SPA and neighborhood component analysis NCA were used to extract the characteristic wavelengths. Moreover DF model and three traditional machine learning models decision tree DT k-nearest neighbor KNN and support vector machine SVM were built based on different numbers of sample sets. After multivariate data analysis it showed that the pretreatment effect of MSC was the most excellent and the characteristic wavelength extracted by NCA algorithm was the most useful. In addition the performance of DF model was better than these three traditional classifier models and it still performed well in small-scale sample set data. Therefore DF model was chosen as the best classification model. The results of this study show that the DF model maintains good classification performance in small-scale sample set data and it has a good application prospect in hyperspectral imaging technology. Hyperspectral imaging technology combined with deep forest model to identify frost-damaged rice seeds.
