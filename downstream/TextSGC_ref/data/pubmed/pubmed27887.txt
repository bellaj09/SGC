This article addresses the issue of representing electroencephalographic EEG signals in an efficient way. While classical approaches use a fixed Gabor dictionary to analyze EEG signals this article proposes a data-driven method to obtain an adapted dictionary. To reach an efficient dictionary learning appropriate spatial and temporal modeling is required. Inter-channels links are taken into account in the spatial multivariate model and shift-invariance is used for the temporal model. Multivariate learned kernels are informative a few atoms code plentiful energy and interpretable the atoms can have a physiological meaning. Using real EEG data the proposed method is shown to outperform the classical multichannel matching pursuit used with a Gabor dictionary as measured by the representative power of the learned dictionary and its spatial flexibility. Moreover dictionary learning can capture interpretable patterns: this ability is illustrated on real data learning a P300 evoked potential. Multivariate temporal dictionary learning for EEG.
