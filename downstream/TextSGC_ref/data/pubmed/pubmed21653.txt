The Subjective Visual Vertical SVV is a common test for evaluating the perception of verticality. Altered verticality has been connected with disorders in the otolithic visual or proprioceptive systems caused by stroke Parkinson\s disease or multiple sclerosis among others. Currently this test is carried out using a variety of specific mostly homemade apparatuses that include moving planes buckets hemispheric domes or a line projected in a screen. Our aim is to develop a flexible inexpensive user-friendly and easily extensible system based on virtual reality for the measurement of the SVV and several related visual diagnostic tests and validate it through an experimental evaluation. Two different hardware configurations were tested with 50 healthy volunteers in a controlled environment; 28 of them were males and 22 females with ages ranging from 18 to 49\xa0years being 23 the average age. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ICC was computed in each device. In addition a usability survey was conducted. ICC\u2009=\u20090.85 in the first configuration CI\u2009=\u20090.75-0.92 ICC\u2009=\u20090.76 in the second configuration CI\u2009=\u20090.61-0.87 both with 95% of confidence which means a substantial reliability. Moreover 92.2% of subjects rated the usability of the system as "very good". Our evaluation showed that the proposed system is suitable for the measurement of SVV in healthy subjects. The next step is to perform a more elaborated experimentation on patients and compare the results with the measurements obtained from traditional methods.
