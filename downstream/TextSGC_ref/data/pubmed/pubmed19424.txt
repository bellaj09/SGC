In the future humans are likely to be exposed to environments with altered gravity conditions be it only visually Virtual and Augmented Reality or visually and bodily space travel. As visually and bodily perceived gravity as well as an interiorized representation of earth gravity are involved in a series of tasks such as catching grasping body orientation estimation and spatial inferences humans will need to adapt to these new gravity conditions. Performance under earth gravity discrepant conditions has been shown to be relatively poor and few studies conducted in gravity adaptation are rather discouraging. Especially in VR on earth conflicts between bodily and visual gravity cues seem to make a full adaptation to visually perceived earth-discrepant gravities nearly impossible and even in space when visual and bodily cues are congruent adaptation is extremely slow. We invoke a Bayesian framework for gravity related perceptual processes in which earth gravity holds the status of a so called "strong prior". As other strong priors the gravity prior has developed through years and years of experience in an earth gravity environment. For this reason the reliability of this representation is extremely high and overrules any sensory information to its contrary. While also other factors such as the multisensory nature of gravity perception need to be taken into account we present the strong prior account as a unifying explanation for empirical results in gravity perception and adaptation to earth-discrepant gravities.
