"In vestibular schwannoma patients with functional hearing status surgical resection while preserving the hearing is feasible. Hearing levels tumor size and location of the tumor have been known to be candidates of predictors. We used a machine learning approach to predict hearing outcomes in vestibular schwannoma patients who underwent hearing preservation surgery: middle cranial fossa or retrosigmoid approach. After reviewing the medical records of 52 patients with a pathologically confirmed vestibular schwannoma we included 50 patients records in the study. Hearing preservation was regarded as positive if the postoperative hearing was within serviceable hearing 50/50 rule. The categorical variable included the surgical approach and the continuous variable covered audiometric and vestibular function tests and the largest diameter of the tumor. Four different algorithms were lined up for comparison of accuracy: support vector machineSVM gradient boosting machineGBM deep neural networkDNN and diffuse random forestDRF. The average accuracy of predicting hearing preservation ranged from 62% SVM to 90% DNN. The current study is the first to incorporate machine learning methodology into a prediction of successful hearing preservation surgery. Although a larger population may be needed for better generalization this study could aid the surgeons decision to perform a hearing preservation approach for vestibular schwannoma surgery."
