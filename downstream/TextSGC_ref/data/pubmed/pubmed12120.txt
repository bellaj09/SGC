We reformulate the projected imaginary-time evolution of the full configuration interaction quantum Monte\xa0Carlo method in terms of a Lagrangian minimization. This naturally leads to the admission of polynomial complex wave function parametrizations circumventing the exponential scaling of the approach. While previously these functions have traditionally inhabited the domain of variational Monte\xa0Carlo approaches we consider recent developments for the identification of deep-learning neural networks to optimize this Lagrangian which can be written as a modification of the propagator for the wave function dynamics. We demonstrate this approach with a form of tensor network state and use it to find solutions to the strongly correlated Hubbard model as well as its application to a fully periodic ab\xa0initio graphene sheet. The number of variables which can be simultaneously optimized greatly exceeds alternative formulations of variational Monte\xa0Carlo methods allowing for systematic improvability of the wave function flexibility towards exactness for a number of different forms while blurring the line between traditional variational and projector quantum Monte\xa0Carlo approaches.
