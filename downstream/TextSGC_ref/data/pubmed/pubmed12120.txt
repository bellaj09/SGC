Unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs or drones are a very promising branch of technology and they have been utilized in agriculture-in cooperation with image processing technologies-for phenotyping and vigor diagnosis. One of the problems in the utilization of UAVs for agricultural purposes is the limitation in flight time. It is necessary to fly at a high altitude to capture the maximum number of plants in the limited time available but this reduces the spatial resolution of the captured images. In this study we applied a super-resolution method to the low-resolution images of tomato diseases to recover detailed appearances such as lesions on plant organs. We also conducted disease classification using high-resolution low-resolution and super-resolution images to evaluate the effectiveness of super-resolution methods in disease classification. Our results indicated that the super-resolution method outperformed conventional image scaling methods in spatial resolution enhancement of tomato disease images. The results of disease classification showed that the accuracy attained was also better by a large margin with super-resolution images than with low-resolution images. These results indicated that our approach not only recovered the information lost in low-resolution images but also exerted a beneficial influence on further image analysis. The proposed approach will accelerate image-based phenotyping and vigor diagnosis in the field because it not only saves time to capture images of a crop in a cultivation field but also secures the accuracy of these images for further analysis.
