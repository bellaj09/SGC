This article presents the novel Python C# and JavaScript libraries of Node Primitives NEP a high-level open distributed and component-based framework designed to enable easy development of cross-platform software architectures. NEP is built on top of low-level high-performance and robust sockets libraries ZeroMQ and Nanomsg and robot middlewares ROS 1 and ROS 2. This enables platform-independent development of Human-Robot Interaction HRI software architectures. We show minimal code examples for enabling Publish/Subscribe communication between Internet of Things IoT and Robotics modules. Two user cases performed outside laboratories are briefly described in order to prove the technological feasibility of NEP for developing real-world applications. The first user case briefly shows the potential of using NEP for enabling the creation of End-User Development EUD interfaces for IoT-aided Human-Robot Interaction. The second user case briefly describes a software architecture integrating state-of-art sensory devices deep learning perceptual modules and a ROS -based humanoid robot to enable IoT-aided HRI in a public space. Finally a comparative study showed better latency results of NEP over a popular state-of-art tool ROS using rosbridge for connecting different nodes executed in local-host and local area network LAN.
