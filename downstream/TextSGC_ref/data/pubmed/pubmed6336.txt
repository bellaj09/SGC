The distributed white matter network underlying language leads to difficulties in extracting clinically meaningful summaries of neural alterations leading to language impairment. Here we determine the predictive ability of the structural connectome SC compared with global measures of white matter tract microstructure and clinical data to discriminate language impaired patients with temporal lobe epilepsy TLE from TLE patients without language impairment. The white matter connectome as an individualized biomarker of language impairment in temporal lobe epilepsy.
