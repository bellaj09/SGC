1 Examine performance on an objective measure of reward-related cognitive impulsivity delay discounting among self-reported habitual short sleepers and medium i.e. recommended 7-9 hours length sleepers either reporting or not reporting daytime dysfunction; 2 Inform the debate regarding what type and duration of short sleep e.g. 21 to 24 hours of total sleep deprivation self-reported habitual short sleep duration meaningfully influences cognitive impulsivity; 3 Compare the predictive utility of sleep duration and perceived dysfunction to other factors previously shown to influence cognitive impulsivity via delay discounting performance age income education and fluid intelligence. Objective cognitive functioning in self-reported habitual short sleepers not reporting daytime dysfunction: examination of impulsivity via delay discounting.
