Many microsurgical training models exist. These can be broadly classified into living and non-living. The latter type can be further sub-classified into non-vital prosthetic and virtual reality models. We review each model within these sub-groups with reference to the ideal properties of a training model. The most important attribute of any model is that the skills acquired from it must translate efficiently into microsurgical skill in the clinical situation. We believe that non-vital and prosthetic models are an important complement to living ones in training and maintaining the skills of all microsurgeons. As virtual reality technology improves virtual models may succeed the rat as the microsurgical training tool of choice. Non-vital prosthetic and virtual reality models of microsurgical training.
