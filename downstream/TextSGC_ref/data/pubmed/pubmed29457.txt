Brain-computer interfaces BCIs have been studied extensively in order to establish a non-muscular communication channel mainly for patients with impaired motor functions. However many limitations remain for BCIs in clinical use. In this study we propose a hybrid BCI that is based on only frontal brain areas and can be operated in an eyes-closed state for end users with impaired motor and declining visual functions. In our experiment electroencephalography EEG and near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS were simultaneously measured while 12 participants performed mental arithmetic MA and remained relaxed baseline state: BL. To evaluate the feasibility of the hybrid BCI we classified MA- from BL-related brain activation. We then compared classification accuracies using two unimodal BCIs EEG and NIRS and the hybrid BCI in an offline mode. The classification accuracy of the hybrid BCI 83.9  10.3% was shown to be significantly higher than those of unimodal EEG-based 77.3  15.9% and NIRS-based BCI 75.9  6.3%. The analytical results confirmed performance improvement with the hybrid BCI particularly for only frontal brain areas. Our study shows that an eyes-closed hybrid BCI approach based on frontal areas could be applied to neurodegenerative patients who lost their motor functions including oculomotor functions.
