The use of virtual reality or three-dimensional 3D simulation programs has been explored in different mental health problems and contexts. One of the applications that showed evidence of a suitable assessment for behavioral and emotional problems in adolescents is the 3D questionnaire called MySchool4web. The aim of this work was to analyze the psychometric properties of a tailored version of MySchool4web.
