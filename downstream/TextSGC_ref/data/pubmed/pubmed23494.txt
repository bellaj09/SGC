Reducing the mechanical mismatch between the stiffness of a neural implant and the softness of the neural tissue is still an open challenge in neuroprosthetics. The emergence of conductive hydrogels in the last few years has considerably widened the spectrum of possibilities to tackle this issue. Nevertheless despite the advancements in this field further improvements in the fabrication of conductive hydrogel-based electrodes are still required. In this work we report the fabrication of a conductive hydrogel-based microelectrode array for neural recording using a hybrid material composed of poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene-polystyrenesulfonate and alginate. The mechanical properties of the conductive hydrogel have been investigated using imaging techniques while the electrode arrays have been electrochemically characterized at each fabrication step and successfully validated both in vitro and in vivo. The presence of the conductive hydrogel selectively electrodeposited onto the platinum microelectrodes allowed achieving superior electrochemical characteristics leading to a lower electrical noise during recordings. These findings represent an advancement in the design of soft conductive electrodes for neuroprosthetic applications.
