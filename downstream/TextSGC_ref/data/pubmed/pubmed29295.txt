Motor imagery brain-computer interfaces MI-BCIs based on electroencephalography EEG a promising technology to provide assistance and support rehabilitation of neurological patients with sensorimotor impairments require a reliable and adaptable subject-specific model to efficiently decode motor intention. The most popular EEG feature extraction algorithm for MI-BCIs is the common spatial patterns CSP method but its performance strongly depends on the predefined frequency band and time segment length for analyzing the EEG signal. A penalized time-frequency band feature selection and classification procedure for improved motor intention decoding in multichannel EEG.
