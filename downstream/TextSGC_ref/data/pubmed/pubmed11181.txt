Changes in brain morphology and white matter lesions are two hallmarks of multiple sclerosis MS pathology but their variability beyond volumetrics is poorly characterized. To further our understanding of complex MS pathology we aim to build a statistical model of brain images that can automatically discover spatial patterns of variability in brain morphology and lesion distribution. We propose building such a model using a deep belief network DBN a layered network whose parameters can be learned from training images. In contrast to other manifold learning algorithms the DBN approach does not require a prebuilt proximity graph which is particularly advantageous for modeling lesions because their sparse and random nature makes defining a suitable distance measure between lesion images challenging. Our model consists of a morphology DBN a lesion DBN and a joint DBN that models concurring morphological and lesion patterns. Our results show that this model can automatically discover the classic patterns of MS pathology as well as more subtle ones and that the parameters computed have strong relationships to MS clinical scores.
