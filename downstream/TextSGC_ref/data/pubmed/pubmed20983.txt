The concept of the information society is now a common one as opposed to the industrial society that dominated the economy during the last years. It is assumed that all sectors should have access to information and reap its benefits. Elderly people are in this respect a major challenge due to their lack of interest in technological progress and their lack of knowledge regarding the potential benefits that information society technologies might have on their lives. The Naviga Project An Open and Adaptable Platform for the Elderly and Persons with Disability to Access the Information Society is a European effort whose main goal is to design and develop a technological platform allowing elder people and persons with disability to access the internet and the information society.
