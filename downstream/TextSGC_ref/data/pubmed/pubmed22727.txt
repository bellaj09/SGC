"The goal of this experiment was to validate an experimental set-up for studying locomotor pointing. The specific and also original element of this set-up was the interactive nature of virtual reality and movement production. This interaction was achieved through the coupling of a treadmill and a Silicon Graphics system. This latter system generated on a screen 3 x 2.3 m an environmental array that moved according to the action produced by subjects on a treadmill. The task was to place either foot on a spatial target that appeared on the floor in front of the subjects displacement trajectory. We analyzed the step length patterns of subjects approaching these targets along with the current target-subject relationship. The results are in agreement with a perception-action coupling type of control mechanism that operates continuously as the subject approaches the desired target. Apparently these findings mirror observations of real-life locomotion indicating that the present set-up provides a valid and useful tool for examining human locomotion."
