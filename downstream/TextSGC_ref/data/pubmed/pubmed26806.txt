Dual-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP was suggested to generate more stimuli using a few flickering frequencies for brain-computer interface. Dual--frequency SSVEP peaks at more than two frequencies-both main and harmonic frequencies. However multi-frequency recognition strategy has not been investigated for dual-frequency SSVEP. In this paper three modified power spectral density analysis PSDA methods and two modified canonical correlation analysis CCA methods were tested for dual-frequency SSVEP classification. Three methods among the five methods used conventional features or classification techniques and the other two methods used modified features for harmonic frequencies. As a result CCA with novel features showed the best BCI performance. Also the use of harmonic frequencies improved BCI performance of dual-frequency SSVEP. Frequency recognition methods for dual-frequency SSVEP based brain-computer interface.
