Although motor learning theory has led to evidence-based practices few trials have revealed the superiority of one theory-based therapy over another after stroke. Nor have improvements in skills been as clinically robust as one might hope. We review some possible explanations then potential technology-enabled solutions. Over the Internet the type quantity and quality of practice and exercise in the home and community can be monitored remotely and feedback provided to optimize training frequency intensity and progression at home. A theory-driven foundation of synergistic interventions for walking reaching and grasping strengthening and fitness could be provided by a bundle of home-based Rehabilitation Internet-of-Things RIoT devices. A RIoT might include wearable activity-recognition sensors and instrumented rehabilitation devices with radio transmission to a smartphone or tablet to continuously measure repetitions speed accuracy forces and temporal spatial features of movement. Using telerehabilitation resources a therapist would interpret the data and provide behavioral training for self-management via goal setting and instruction to increase compliance and long-term carryover. On top of this user-friendly safe and conceptually sound foundation to support more opportunity for practice experimental interventions could be tested or additions and replacements made perhaps drawing from virtual reality and gaming programs or robots. RIoT devices continuously measure the actual amount of quality practice; improvements and plateaus over time in strength fitness and skills; and activity and participation in home and community settings. Investigators may gain more control over some of the confounders of their trials and patients will have access to inexpensive therapies.
