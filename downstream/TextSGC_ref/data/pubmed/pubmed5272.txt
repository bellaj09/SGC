Establishing reliable robust and unique brain signatures from neuroimaging data is a prerequisite for precision psychiatry and therefore a highly sought-after goal in contemporary neuroscience. Recently the procedure of connectome fingerprinting using brain functional connectivity profiles as such signatures was shown to be able to accurately identify individuals from a group of 126 subjects from the Human Connectome Project HCP. However the specificity and generalizability of this procedure were not tested. In this replication study we show both for the original and an extended HCP data set n\xa0=\xa0900 subjects as well as for an additional data set of more commonly acquired imaging quality n\xa0=\xa084 that i although the high accuracy can be replicated for the larger HCP 900 data set accuracy is ii lower for standard neuroimaging data and that iii connectome fingerprinting may not be specific enough to distinguish between individuals. In addition both accuracy and specificity are projected to drop considerably as the size of a data set increases. Although the moderate-to-high accuracies do suggest there is a portion of unique variance our results suggest that connectomes may actually be quite similar across individuals. This outcome may be relevant to how precision psychiatry could benefit from inferences based on functional connectomes. Evaluating the replicability specificity and generalizability of connectome fingerprints.
