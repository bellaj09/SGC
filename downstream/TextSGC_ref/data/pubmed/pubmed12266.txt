Generic and scalable data analysis procedures are highly demanded by the increasing number of multi-dimensional biomedical data. However especially for time-lapse biological data the high level of noise prevents for automated high-throughput analysis methods. The rapid developing of machine-learning methods and particularly deep-learning methods provide new tools and methodologies that can help in the denoising of such data. Using a convolutional encoder-decoder network one can provide a scalable bio-image platform called NucleiNet to automatically segment classify and track cell nuclei. The proposed method can achieve 0.99 F-score and 0.99 pixel-wise accuracy on C. elegans dataset which means that over 99% of nuclei can be successfully detected with no merging nuclei found.
