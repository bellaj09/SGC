Deep learning DL is increasingly used to solve ill-posed inverse problems in medical imaging such as reconstruction from noisy and/or incomplete data as DL offers advantages over conventional methods that rely on explicit image features and hand engineered priors. However supervised DL-based methods may achieve poor performance when the test data deviates from the training data for example when it has pathologies not encountered in the training data. Furthermore DL-based image reconstructions do not always incorporate the underlying forward physical model which may improve performance. Therefore in this work we introduce a novel approach called fidelity imposed network edit FINE which modifies the weights of a pre-trained reconstruction network for each case in the testing dataset. This is achieved by minimizing an unsupervised fidelity loss function that is based on the forward physical model. FINE is applied to two important inverse problems in neuroimaging: quantitative susceptibility mapping QSM and under-sampled image reconstruction in MRI. Our experiments demonstrate that FINE can improve reconstruction accuracy. Fidelity imposed network edit FINE for solving ill-posed image reconstruction.
