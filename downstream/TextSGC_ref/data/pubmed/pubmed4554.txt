"Connectome-based predictive modeling CPM is a recently developed machine-learning-based framework to predict individual differences in behavior from functional brain connectivity FC. In these models FC was operationalized as Pearsons correlation between brain regions fMRI time courses. However Pearsons correlation is limited since it only captures linear relationships. We developed a more generalized metric of FC based on information flow. This measure represents FC by abstracting the brain as a flow network of nodes that send bits of information to each other where bits are quantified through an information theory statistic called transfer entropy." An information network flow approach for measuring functional connectivity and predicting behavior.
