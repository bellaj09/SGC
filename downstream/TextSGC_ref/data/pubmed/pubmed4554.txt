Improvement of neuronal recovery in the ischemic penumbra around a brain infarct has a large potential to advance clinical recovery of patients with acute ischemic stroke. However pathophysiological mechanisms leading to either recovery or secondary damage in the penumbra are not completely understood. We studied neuronal dynamics in a model system of the penumbra consisting of networks of cultured cortical neurons exposed to controlled levels and durations of hypoxia. Short periods of hypoxia pO220mmHg reduced spontaneous activity due to impeded synaptic function. After 6 hours activity and connectivity partially recovered even during continuing hypoxia. If the oxygen supply was restored within 12 hours changes in network connectivity were completely reversible. For longer periods of hypoxia 12-30 h activity levels initially increased but eventually decreased and connectivity changes became partially irreversible. After 30 hours all functional connections disappeared and no activity remained. Since this complete silence seemed unrelated to hypoxic depths but always followed an extended period of low activity we speculate that irreversible damage at least partly results from insufficient neuronal activation. This opens avenues for therapies to improve recovery by neuronal activation. Progression of Neuronal Damage in an In Vitro Model of the Ischemic Penumbra.
