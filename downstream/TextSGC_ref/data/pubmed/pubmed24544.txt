During abstinence from alcohol craving is elicited by the cues and contexts previously associated with alcohol which contribute to relapse. To prevent the craving and relapse experienced by alcoholics cue-exposure therapy CET has been used to extinguish the association between alcohol and alcohol-related cues and contexts. This study applied CET using a virtual reality VR system to eight members of an Alcoholics Anonymous group for eight sessions. Cues and contexts most likely to elicit an urge to drink were selected through a preliminary survey in order to compose VR-CET scenarios: a glass a bottle food and a bar were judged to be the most tempting for people in alcohol dependence and abstinence. Using these cues and contexts a Japanese-style pub and a western bar were created. Each session was administered for 30 minutes by a psychiatrist and included an introduction immersion VR navigation interviews about feelings and self-report questionnaires about cravings. The eight sessions consisted of initial and closing sessions and person- object- and situation-focused sessions. As a result a reduction in cue-elicited craving after VR-CET was reported. A mean score of 15.75 SD = 10.91 on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire in the first session decreased to 11.50 SD = 5.76 in the final session. This study suggests that using virtual reality can enhance the effectiveness of CET. Cue-exposure therapy to decrease alcohol craving in virtual environment.
