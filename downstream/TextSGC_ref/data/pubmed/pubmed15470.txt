The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of metacognitive strategies on self-regulated learning processes focusing on the mediating effects of self-efficacy. The surveys were conducted in December 2016 Time 1 and January 2017 Time 2. One hundred and five undergraduates enrolled at a Japanese university participated in this survey study consisting of two surveys conducted one month apart. The questionnaires measured the use of metacognitive strategies i.e. planning strategy and monitoring strategy self-efficacy general learning behaviors behavioral engagement and persistence and the use of cognitive strategies i.e. writing-repetition strategy and deep-processing strategy. First cross-lagged structure equation modeling revealed that the use of planning strategy enhanced self-efficacy. Second path analysis examined relationships between metacognitive strategies general learning behaviors and cognitive strategies. It revealed that a general learning behaviors were promoted by metacognitive strategies mediated by self-efficacy and b cognitive strategies were almost directly affected by the monitoring strategy. The current study reveals that general learning behaviors and cognitive strategies involve different processes than metacognitive strategies.
