In the burgeoning field of e-mental health interventions avatars are increasingly being utilized to facilitate online communication between clients and therapists and among peers. Avatars are digital self-representations which enable individuals to interact with each other in computer-based virtual environments. In this narrative review we examine the psychotherapeutic applications of avatars that have been investigated and trialed to date. Five key applications were identified 1 in the formation of online peer support communities; 2 replicating traditional modes of psychotherapy by using avatars as a vehicle to communicate within a wholly virtual environment; 3 using avatar technology to facilitate or augment face-to-face treatment; 4 as part of serious games; and 5 communication with an autonomous virtual therapist. Across these applications avatars appeared to serve several functions conducive to treatment engagement by 1 facilitating the development of a virtual therapeutic alliance; 2 reducing communication barriers; 3 promoting treatment-seeking through anonymity; 4 promoting expression and exploration of client identity; and 5 enabling therapists to control and manipulate treatment stimuli. Further research into the feasibility and ethical implementation of avatar-based psychotherapies is required. What Role Can Avatars Play in e-Mental Health Interventions?
