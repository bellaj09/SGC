In this paper a method is proposed to implement noises reduced three-dimensional 3D holographic near-eye display by phase-only computer-generated hologram CGH. The CGH is calculated from a double-convergence light Gerchberg-Saxton GS algorithm in which the phases of two virtual convergence lights are introduced into GS algorithm simultaneously. The first phase of convergence light is a replacement of random phase as the iterative initial value and the second phase of convergence light will modulate the phase distribution calculated by GS algorithm. Both simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results indicate that this method can effectively reduce the noises in the reconstruction. Field of view FOV of the reconstructed image reaches 40 degrees and experimental light path in the 4-f system is shortened. As for 3D experiments the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can present 3D images with 180cm zooming range and continuous depth cues. This method may provide a promising solution in future 3D augmented reality AR realization. Holographic near-eye display system based on double-convergence light Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm.
