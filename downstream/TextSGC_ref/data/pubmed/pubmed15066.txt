Lung cancer is one of the most harmful malignant tumors to human health. The accurate judgment of the pathological type of lung cancer is vital for treatment. Traditionally the pathological type of lung cancer requires a histopathological examination to determine which is invasive and time consuming. In this work a novel residual neural network is proposed to identify the pathological type of lung cancer via CT images. Due to the low amount of CT images in practice we explored a medical-to-medical transfer learning strategy. Specifically a residual neural network is pre-trained on public medical images dataset luna16 and then fine-tuned on our intellectual property lung cancer dataset collected in Shandong Provincial Hospital. Data experiments show that our method achieves 85.71% accuracy in identifying pathological types of lung cancer from CT images and outperforming other models trained with 2054 labels. Our method performs better than AlexNet VGG16 and DenseNet which provides an efficient non-invasive detection tool for pathological diagnosis.
