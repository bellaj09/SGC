The imaging principles and phenomena of integral imaging technique have been studied in detail using geometrical optics wave optics or light filed theory. However most of the conclusions are only suit for the integral imaging systems using diffused illumination. In this work a kind of twin imaging phenomenon and mechanism has been observed in a non-diffused illumination reflective integral imaging system. Interactive twin images including a real and a virtual 3D image of one object can be activated in the system. The imaging phenomenon is similar to the conjugate imaging effect of hologram but it base on the refraction and reflection instead of diffraction. The imaging characteristics and mechanisms different from traditional integral imaging are deduced analytically. Thin film integral imaging systems with 80m thickness have also been made to verify the imaging phenomenon. Vivid lighting interactive twin 3D images have been realized using a light-emitting diode LED light source. When the LED is moving the twin 3D images are moving synchronously. This interesting phenomenon shows a good application prospect in interactive 3D display argument reality and security authentication. Twin imaging phenomenon of integral imaging.
