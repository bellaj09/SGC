"Histone deacetylase 6 HDAC6 plays a key role in a variety of neurological disorders which makes it attractive drug target for the treatment of Alzheimers disease Parkinsons disease and memory/learning impairment. The selectivity of HDAC6 inhibitors sHDAC6Is are widely considered to be susceptible to the sizes of their Cap group and the physicochemical properties of their linker or zinc-binding group which makes the discovery of new sHDAC6Is extremely difficult. With the discovery of the distinct selectivity between Trichostatin A TSA enantiomers the chirality residing in the connective units between TSAs Cap and linker shows a great impact on its selectivity. However the mechanism underlining  S-TSAs selectivity is still elusive and the way chirality switches the selective  S-TSA to nonselective  R-TSA is unknown. In this study multiple computational approaches were collectively applied to explore validate and differentiate the binding modes of two TSA enantiomers in HDACs especially the HDAC6 at atomic level. First two nonconservative residues G200/M205 and Y197/F202 in HDAC1/6 in loop3 and four conservative residues deep inside the hydrophobic binding pocket were discovered as the decisive residues of  S-TSAs selectivity toward HDAC6. Then a novel mechanism underlying the selectivity of  S-TSA toward HDAC6 was proposed which was composed of the trigger by two nonconservative residues F202 and M205 in HDAC6 and a subsequently improved fit of  S-TSA deep inside HDAC6s hydrophobic binding pocket. TSA enantiomers were used as a molecular probe to explore the mechanism underlying sHDAC6Is selectivity in this study. Because of their decisive roles in  S-TSAs selectivity to HDAC6 both F202 and M205 in HDAC6 should be especially considered in the discovery of novel sHDAC6Is."
