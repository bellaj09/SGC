Rehabilitation is considered as an adjuvant to pharmacological and surgical treatments for Parkinson\s disease PD to maximize functional ability and minimize secondary complications. Originally approaches were based on empirical experience but growing evidence suggests that exercise-dependent plasticity constitutes the main mechanism underlying the effects of physiotherapy. Exercise increases synaptic strength and influences neurotransmission thus potentiating functional circuitry in PD. In addition exercise is a pivotal element of motor learning. PD patients retain a sufficient capacity of motor learning though learning rates and performance are reduced in comparison to normal controls. Recent meta-analyses demonstrated that rehabilitation could induce short-lasting but clinically important benefits particularly for gait and balance. However the interventions are largely heterogeneous stretching muscle strengthening balance postural exercises occupational therapy cueing treadmill training and there is still no consensus about the optimal approach. Innovative techniques have been recently proposed: virtual reality and exergaming motor imagery and action observation robot-assisted physiotherapy and non-conventional therapies e.g.: dance martial arts. The rehabilitative program for PD should be "goal-based" targeted to practicing and learning specific activities in the core areas but a number of practice variables intensity specificity complexity need to be identified and the program should tailored to the individual patients\ characteristics.
