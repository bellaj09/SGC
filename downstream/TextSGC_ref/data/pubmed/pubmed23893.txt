Video games have been shown to improve eye-hand coordination spatial visualization manual dexterity and rapid mental processing which are important in the acquisition of laparoscopic skills. This study investigated the relationship between playing Nintendo Wii and virtual reality VR laparoscopic surgery simulator performance. We hypothesized that playing the Wii would improve surgical skills performance on a VR laparoscopic simulator and hoped to elucidate which tasks in particular would be most beneficial for nondominant hand training. Improved nondominant hand performance on a laparoscopic virtual reality simulator after playing the Nintendo Wii.
