Deep learning demonstrates greater competence over traditional machine learning techniques for many tasks. In last several years deep learning has been applied to protein function prediction and a series of good achievements has been obtained. These findings extensively advanced our understanding of protein function. However the accuracy of protein function prediction based upon deep learning still has yet to be improved. In article number 1900019 Issue 12 Zhang et\xa0al. construct DeepFunc a deep learning framework using derived feature information of protein sequence and protein interactions network. They find that implementing DeepFunc for protein function prediction is more accurate than using DeepGO a similar method reported previously. Meanwhile they find that the method of combining multiple derived feature information in DeepFunc is much better than the method of using only single derived feature information. Due to its fully exploiting feature representation learning ability deep learning with more derived feature information will enable it to be a promising method for solving more complicated protein function prediction problems and other bioinformatics challenges. Recent researches have provided some major insights into the value for using deep learning to protein function prediction problem.
