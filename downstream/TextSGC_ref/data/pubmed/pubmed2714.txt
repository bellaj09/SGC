Several methodological challenges affect the study of typical brain development based on resting state blood oxygenation level dependent BOLD functional MRI fMRI. One such challenge is mitigating artifacts such as those from head motion known to be more substantial in younger subjects than older subjects. Other challenges include controlling for potential age-dependence in cerebrospinal fluid CSF volume affecting anatomical-functional coregistration; in vascular density affecting BOLD contrast-to-noise; and in CSF pulsation creating time series artifacts. Historically these confounds have been approached through incorporating artifact-specific temporal and/or spatial filtering into preprocessing pipelines. However such paths often come with new confounds or limitations. In this study we take the approach of a bottom-up revision of fMRI methodology based on acquisition of multi-echo fMRI and comprehensive utilization of the information in the TE-domain to enhance several aspects of fMRI analysis in the context of a developmental study. We show in a cohort of 25 healthy subjects aged 9 to 43 years that the analysis of multi-echo fMRI data eliminates a number of arbitrary processing steps such as bandpass filtering and spatial smoothing while enabling procedures such as Formula: see text mapping BOLD contrast normalization and signal dropout recovery precise anatomical-functional coregistration based on Formula: see text measurements automatic denoising through removing subject motion scanner-related signal drifts and physiology as well as statistical inference for seed-based connectivity. These enhancements are of both theoretical significance and practical benefit in the study of typical brain development.
