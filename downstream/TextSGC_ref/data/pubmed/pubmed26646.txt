Recordings from chronically implanted multielectrode arrays have become prevalent in both neuroscience and neural engineering experiments. To date however the extent to which populations of single-units remain stable over long periods of time has not been well characterized. In this study neural activity was recorded from a Utah multielectrode array implanted in the primary motor cortex of a rhesus macaque during 18 recording sessions spanning nine months. We found that 67% of the units were stable through the first 15 days 31% of units were stable through 47 days 21% of units were stable through 106 days and 8% of units were stable over 9 months. Thus not only were units stable over a timescale of several months but units stable over 2 months were more likely to remain stable in the next 2 months. Ultra-long term stability of single units using chronically implanted multielectrode arrays.
