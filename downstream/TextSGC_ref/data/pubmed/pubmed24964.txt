Carbon fiber electrodes may enable better long-term brain implants minimizing the tissue response commonly seen with silicon-based electrodes. The small diameter fiber may enable high-channel count brain-machine interfaces capable of reproducing dexterous movements. Past carbon fiber electrodes exhibited both high fidelity single unit recordings and a healthy neuronal population immediately adjacent to the recording site. However the recording yield of our carbon fiber arrays chronically implanted in the brain typically hovered around 30% for previously unknown reasons. In this paper we investigated fabrication process modifications aimed at increasing recording yield and longevity. Ultra-small carbon fiber electrode recording site optimization and improved in vivo chronic recording yield.
