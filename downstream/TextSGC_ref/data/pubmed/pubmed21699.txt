As an emerging technology brain-computer interfaces BCIs bring us new communication interfaces which translate brain activities into control signals for devices like computers robots and so forth. In this study we propose a semisupervised support vector machine SVM algorithm for brain-computer interface BCI systems aiming at reducing the time-consuming training process. In this algorithm we apply a semisupervised SVM for translating the features extracted from the electrical recordings of brain into control signals. This SVM classifier is built from a small labeled data set and a large unlabeled data set. Meanwhile to reduce the time for training semisupervised SVM we propose a batch-mode incremental learning method which can also be easily applied to the online BCI systems. Additionally it is suggested in many studies that common spatial pattern CSP is very effective in discriminating two different brain states. However CSP needs a sufficient labeled data set. In order to overcome the drawback of CSP we suggest a two-stage feature extraction method for the semisupervised learning algorithm. We apply our algorithm to two BCI experimental data sets. The offline data analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. A semisupervised support vector machines algorithm for BCI systems.
