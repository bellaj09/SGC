To date a diagnosis in psychiatry is largely based on a clinical interview and questionnaires. The retrospective and subjective nature of these methods leads to recall and interviewer biases. Therefore there is a clear need for more objective and standardized assessment methods to support the diagnostic process. The introduction of virtual reality VR creates the possibility to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Therefore VR could contribute to the objectivity and reliability in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Virtual Reality Objectifies the Diagnosis of Psychiatric Disorders: A Literature Review.
