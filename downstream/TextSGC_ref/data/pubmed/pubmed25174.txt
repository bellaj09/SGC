Target image detection based on a rapid serial visual presentation RSVP paradigm is a typical brain-computer interface system with various applications such as image retrieval. In an RSVP paradigm a P300 component is detected to determine target images. This strategy requires high-precision single-trial P300 detection methods. However the performance of single-trial detection methods is relatively lower than that of multitrial P300 detection methods. Image retrieval based on multitrial P300 is a new research direction. In this paper we propose a triple-RSVP paradigm with three images being presented simultaneously and a target image appearing three times. Thus multitrial P300 classification methods can be used to improve detection accuracy. In this study these mechanisms were extended and validated and the characteristics of the multi-RSVP framework were further explored. Two different P300 detection algorithms were also utilized in multi-RSVP to demonstrate that the scheme is universally applicable. Results revealed that the detection accuracy of the multi-RSVP paradigm was higher than that of the standard RSVP paradigm. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and this method can provide a whole new idea in the field of EEG-based target detection.
