Recent works show that generative adversarial networks GANs can be successfully applied to image synthesis and semi-supervised learning where given a small labeled database and a large unlabeled database the goal is to train a powerful classifier. In this paper we trained a retinal image synthesizer and a semi-supervised learning method for automatic glaucoma assessment using an adversarial model on a small glaucoma-labeled database and a large unlabeled database. Various studies have shown that glaucoma can be monitored by analyzing the optic disc and its surroundings and for that reason the images used in this paper were automatically cropped around the optic disc. The novelty of this paper is to propose a new retinal image synthesizer and a semi-supervised learning method for glaucoma assessment based on the deep convolutional GANs. In addition and to the best of our knowledge this system is trained on an unprecedented number of publicly available images 86926 images. This system hence is not only able to generate images synthetically but to provide labels automatically. Synthetic images were qualitatively evaluated using t-SNE plots of features associated with the images and their anatomical consistency was estimated by measuring the proportion of pixels corresponding to the anatomical structures around the optic disc. The resulting image synthesizer is able to generate realistic cropped retinal images and subsequently the glaucoma classifier is able to classify them into glaucomatous and normal with high accuracy AUC = 0.9017. The obtained retinal image synthesizer and the glaucoma classifier could then be used to generate an unlimited number of cropped retinal images with glaucoma labels.
