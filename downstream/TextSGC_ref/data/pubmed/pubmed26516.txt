Brain-computer interfaces BCIs aim to enable people to interact with the external world through an alternative nonmuscular communication channel that uses brain signal responses to complete specific cognitive tasks. BCIs have been growing rapidly during the past few years with most of the BCI research focusing on system performance such as improving accuracy or information transfer rate. Despite these advances BCI research and development is still in its infancy and requires further consideration to significantly affect human experience in most real-world environments. This paper reviews the most recent studies and findings about ergonomic issues in BCIs. We review dry electrodes that can be used to detect brain signals with high enough quality to apply in BCIs and discuss their advantages disadvantages and performance. Also an overview is provided of the wide range of recent efforts to create new interface designs that do not induce fatigue or discomfort during everyday long-term use. The basic principles of each technique are described along with examples of current applications in BCI research. Finally we demonstrate a user-friendly interface paradigm that uses dry capacitive electrodes that do not require any preparation procedure for EEG signal acquisition. We explore the capacitively measured steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP response to an amplitude-modulated visual stimulus and the auditory steady-state response ASSR to an auditory stimulus modulated by familiar natural sounds to verify their availability for BCI. We report the first results of an online demonstration that adopted this ergonomic approach to evaluating BCI applications. We expect BCI to become a routine clinical assistive and commercial tool through advanced EEG monitoring techniques and innovative interface designs.
