The speed of super-resolution microscopy methods based on single-molecule localization for example PALM and STORM is limited by the need to record many thousands of frames with a small number of observed molecules in each. Here we present ANNA-PALM a computational strategy that uses artificial neural networks to reconstruct super-resolution views from sparse rapidly acquired localization images and/or widefield images. Simulations and experimental imaging of microtubules nuclear pores and mitochondria show that high-quality super-resolution images can be reconstructed from up to two orders of magnitude fewer frames than usually needed without compromising spatial resolution. Super-resolution reconstructions are even possible from widefield images alone though adding localization data improves image quality. We demonstrate super-resolution imaging of >1000 fields of view containing >1000 cells in 3 h yielding an image spanning spatial scales from 20 nm to 2 mm. The drastic reduction in acquisition time and sample irradiation afforded by ANNA-PALM enables faster and gentler high-throughput and live-cell super-resolution imaging. Deep learning massively accelerates super-resolution localization microscopy.
