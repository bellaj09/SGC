Not only are current imaging techniques - cone-beam computed tomography CT CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI - becoming more precise in capturing data but the illustration and interpretation of the acquired images is no longer limited to conventional display screens or projectors. The so-called "virtual reality" VR glasses have the potential to engage the viewer in a 3-dimensional space and ultimately to enable evaluation of the reconstructed anatomical structures from a new perspective. For the first time in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery OMFS a 3-dimensional imaging dataset cone-beam CT CT and MRI can be evaluated by using VR glasses. A medical student an OMFS resident and an OMFS consultant rated the preoperative usability of VR glasses to improve the operative understanding of three cases: a deeply impacted wisdom tooth a fracture of the lower jaw and an oncological resection. VR glasses seem to help to simplify operations and give the surgeon a good preoperative overview of the intraoperative findings particularly in the evaluation of impacted teeth and hard tissue structures. In addition VR glasses seem to be a promising innovation to help in the training of surgical residents and to teach students. However the more experienced the surgeon the smaller is the additional value of VR glasses. Preoperative examination using VR glasses can aid better understanding and planning of the surgical site in the future and is an innovative piece of advanced technology for displaying CT cone-beam CT and MRI anatomical data. Virtual reality in preoperative imaging in maxillofacial surgery: implementation of "the next level"?
