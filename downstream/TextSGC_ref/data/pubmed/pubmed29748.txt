This paper presents a novel sparse ensemble based machine learning approach to enhance robustness of intracortical Brain Machine Interfaces iBMIs in the face of non-stationary distribution of input neural data across time. Each classifier in the ensemble is trained on a randomly sampled with replacement set of input channels. These sparse connections ensure that with a high chance few of the base classifiers should be less affected by the variations in some of the recording channels. We have tested the generality of this technique on different base classifiers - linear discriminant analysis LDA support vector machine SVM extreme learning machine ELM and multilayer perceptron MLP. Results show decoding accuracy improvements of up to 21 % 13% 19% 10% in non-human primate NHP A and 7% 9% 7% 9% in NHP B across test days while using the sparse ensemble approach over a single classifier model for LDA SVM ELM and MLP algorithms respectively. Furthermore improvements of up to 714% 815% 919% 715% in NHP A and 815% 1220% 1523% 1219% in NHP B over Random Forest Long-short Term Memory have been obtained by sparse ensemble LDA SVM ELM MLP respectively.
