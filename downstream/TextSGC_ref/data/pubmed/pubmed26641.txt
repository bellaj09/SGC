"More than 300 researchers gathered at the 2013 International Brain-Computer Interface BCI Meeting to discuss current practice and future goals for BCI research and development. The authors organized the Virtual Users Forum at the meeting to provide the BCI community with feedback from users. We report on the Virtual Users Forum including initial results from ongoing research being conducted by 2 BCI groups. Online surveys and in-person interviews were used to solicit feedback from people with disabilities who are expert and novice BCI users. For the Virtual Users Forum their responses were organized into 4 major themes: current non-BCI communication methods experiences with BCI research challenges of current BCIs and future BCI developments. Two authors with severe disabilities gave presentations during the Virtual Users Forum and their comments are integrated with the other results. While participants hopes for BCIs of the future remain high their comments about available systems mirror those made by consumers about conventional assistive technology. They reflect concerns about reliability eg typing accuracy/speed utility eg applications and the desire for real-time interactions ease of use eg portability and system setup and support eg technical support and caregiver training. People with disabilities as target users of BCI systems can provide valuable feedback and input on the development of BCI as an assistive technology. To this end participatory action research should be considered as a valuable methodology for future BCI research."
