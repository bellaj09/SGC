Lower-limb exoskeletons have been used in gait rehabilitation to facilitate the restoration of motor skills. These robotics systems could be complemented by Brain-Computer Interfaces BCIs to assist or rehabilitate people with walking disabilities. In this preliminary study electroencephalography-based brain functional connectivity is analyzed during exoskeleton-assisted gait motor imagery MI training. Partial Directed Coherence PDC analysis was employed to assess the exchange of information flow between EEG signals during gait MI in four healthy subjects two using an exoskeleton and two without using it. Besides in order to explore the functional connectivity an outflow index based on the number of significant directed connectivities revealed by the PDC analysis is proposed. We found that the outflow index increases in the central zone C2 C3 C4 while decreases in the central-parietal CP1 CP2 and fronto-central FC1 zones when the training was assisted by an exoskeleton. The results obtained can be useful to obtain informative features for BCI applications as well as in motor rehabilitation.
