Lack of efficient calibration and task guidance in motor imagery MI based brain-computer interface BCI would result in the failure of communication or control especially in patients such as a stroke with motor impairment and intact sensation locked-in state amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in which the sources of data for calibration may worsen the subsequent decoding. In addition enhancing the proprioceptive experience in MI might improve the BCI performance. A novel calibration and task guidance framework for motor imagery BCI via a tendon vibration induced sensation with kinesthesia illusion.
