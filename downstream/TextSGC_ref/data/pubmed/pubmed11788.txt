Entity recognition is one of the most primary steps for text analysis and has long attracted considerable attention from researchers. In the clinical domain various types of entities such as clinical entities and protected health information PHI widely exist in clinical texts. Recognizing these entities has become a hot topic in clinical natural language processing NLP and a large number of traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machine and conditional random field have been deployed to recognize entities from clinical texts in the past few years. In recent years recurrent neural network RNN one of deep learning methods that has shown great potential on many problems including named entity recognition also has been gradually used for entity recognition from clinical texts.
