The success of deep machine learning in processing of large amounts of data for example in image or voice recognition and generation raises the possibilities that these tools can also be applied for solving complex problems in materials science. In this forum article we focus on molecular design that aims to answer the question on how we can predict and synthesize molecules with tailored physical chemical or biological properties. A potential answer to this question could be found by using intelligent systems that integrate physical models and computational machine learning techniques with automated synthesis and characterization tools. Such systems learn through every single experiment in an analogy to a human scientific expert. While the general idea of an autonomous system for molecular synthesis and characterization has been around for a while its implementations for the materials sciences are sparse. Here we provide an overview of the developments in chemistry automation and the applications of machine learning techniques in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries with a focus on the novel capabilities that deep learning brings in. Autonomous Molecular Design: Then and Now.
