"For decades empirical studies have shown the effectiveness of exposure techniques when used in cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT treatment for anxiety disorders. A few studies are now suggesting that using Virtual Reality VR may be an effective way to conduct exposure and overcome some of the limitations of in vivo exposure. The aim of this study is to validate the Specific Work for Exposure Applied in Therapy SWEAT questionnaire that measures costs and efforts required to conduct in vivo and in virtuo exposure. A total of 265 exposure sessions in vivo = 140; in virtuo = 125 were rated by experienced psychologists. Reliability analysis revealed three main factors in the construct of the SWEAT questionnaire. Results also showed that conducting exposure in VR is less of a burden and more readily adapted to the patients needs than in vivo." The development of the SWEAT questionnaire: a scale measuring costs and efforts inherent to conducting exposure sessions.
