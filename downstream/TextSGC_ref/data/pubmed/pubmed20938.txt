This paper presents a study on functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS indicating that the hemodynamic responses of the right- and left-wrist motor imageries have distinct patterns that can be classified using a linear classifier for the purpose of developing a brain-computer interface BCI. Ten healthy participants were instructed to imagine kinesthetically the right- or left-wrist flexion indicated on a computer screen. Signals from the right and left primary motor cortices were acquired simultaneously using a multi-channel continuous-wave fNIRS system. Using two distinct features the mean and the slope of change in the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration the linear discriminant analysis classifier was used to classify the right- and left-wrist motor imageries resulting in average classification accuracies of 73.35% and 83.0% respectively during the 10s task period. Moreover when the analysis time was confined to the 2-7s span within the overall 10s task period the average classification accuracies were improved to 77.56% and 87.28% respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of an fNIRS-based BCI and the enhanced performance of the classifier by removing the initial 2s span and/or the time span after the peak value.
