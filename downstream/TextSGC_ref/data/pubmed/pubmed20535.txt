The present case series with two patients explored whether virtual reality VR distraction could reduce claustrophobia symptoms during a mock magnetic resonance imaging MRI brain scan. Two patients who met DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia situational type i.e. claustrophobia reported high levels of anxiety during a mock 10-min MRI procedure with no VR and asked to terminate the scan early. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either VR or music distraction for their second scan attempt. When immersed in an illusory three-dimensional 3D virtual world named SnowWorld patient 1 was able to complete a 10-min mock scan with low anxiety and reported an increase in self-efficacy afterwards. Patient 2 received "music only" distraction during her second scan but was still not able to complete a 10-min scan and asked to terminate her second scan early. These results suggest that immersive VR may prove effective at temporarily reducing claustrophobia symptoms during MRI scans and music may prove less effective.
