This paper describes evidence that led to the concept of biological embedding and research approaches designed to elucidates its mechanisms. Biological embedding occurs when experience gets under the skin and alters human biological and developmental processes; when systematic differences in experience in different social environments in society lead to systematically different biological and developmental states; when these differences are stable and long term; and finally when they have the capacity to influence health well-being learning or behavior over the life course. Biological embedding emerged from insights in population health on the unique characteristics of socioeconomic gradients: Ubiquity in poor and postscarcity societies alike; gradient seen regardless of whether socioeconomic status is measured by income education or occupation; cutting widely across health well-being learning and behavior outcomes; replicating itself on new conditions entering society; and often showing that flatter gradients mean better overall societal outcomes. Most important the gradient begins the life course as a gradient in developmental health suggesting that the emergence of a multifaceted resilience/vulnerability early in life is the best place to look for evidence of biological embedding. To understand its character the metaphor of the "archeology of biological embedding" has been used wherein the surficial stratum of the "dig" is experience and behavior the shallow stratum is organ system and cellular function and the deep stratum is gene function. We are now ready to address the fundamental question of biological embedding: How do early childhood environments work together with genetic variation and epigenetic regulation to generate gradients in health and human development across the life course? Putting the concept of biological embedding in historical perspective.
