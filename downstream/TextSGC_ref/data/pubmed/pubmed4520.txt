Clinical neuroscience is increasingly turning to imaging the human brain for answers to a range of questions and challenges. To date the majority of studies have focused on the neural basis of current psychiatric symptoms which can facilitate the identification of neurobiological markers for diagnosis. However the increasing availability and feasibility of using imaging modalities such as diffusion imaging and resting-state fMRI enable longitudinal mapping of brain development. This shift in the field is opening the possibility of identifying predictive markers of risk or prognosis and also represents a critical missing element for efforts to promote personalized or individualized medicine in psychiatry i.e. stratified psychiatry.
