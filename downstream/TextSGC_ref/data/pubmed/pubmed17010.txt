This paper proposes an autonomous algorithm to determine the relative pose between the chaser spacecraft and the uncooperative space target which is essential in advanced space applications e.g. on-orbit serving missions. The proposed method named Congruent Tetrahedron Align CTA algorithm uses the very sparse unorganized 3D point cloud acquired by a LIDAR sensor and does not require any prior pose information. The core of the method is to determine the relative pose by looking for the congruent tetrahedron in scanning point cloud and model point cloud on the basis of its known model. The two-level index hash table is built for speeding up the search speed. In addition the Iterative Closest Point ICP algorithm is used for pose tracking after CTA. In order to evaluate the method in arbitrary initial attitude a simulated system is presented. Specifically the performance of the proposed method to provide the initial pose needed for the tracking algorithm is demonstrated as well as their robustness against noise. Finally a field experiment is conducted and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.
