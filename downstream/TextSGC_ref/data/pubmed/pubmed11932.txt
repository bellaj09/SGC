On future missions into deep space astronauts will be required to work more autonomously than on previous missions and thus their ability to perform executive functions could be critical to mission success. In this study we determined the effect that 15 cGy of 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles has on attentional set-shifting ATSET performance of 10 month-old at the time of irradiation male Wistar rats that had been prescreened for their ability to perform the task. Exposure to 1-15 cGy of 56Fe particles leads to a significant impairment in compound discrimination CD performance. Should similar effects occur in astronauts an impaired ability to execute CD would result in a decreased ability to identify and maintain focus on relevant aspects of the task being performed. The use of rats that had been prescreened for ATSET performance helped to establish that working memory of the rules for the food reward remained intact for at least 100 days even after 15 cGy irradiation with 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles but that 56Fe radiation exposure affected associative cue learning/acquisition rather than an intrinsic inability to perform the CD tasks. Our data suggest that declarative memory and the ability to transitively infer established rules also remained intact in the irradiated rats. Thus should similar effects occur in astronauts 56Fe-induced CD performance deficits may only be manifested in scenarios where astronauts are required to transitively apply their knowledge to solve problems that they have not previously encountered; nevertheless potentially one-third of astronauts may not be able to perform event-critical tasks correctly. The implication of this data from a probabilistic risk assessment perspective is that cognitive performance studies that use nave rodents thus requiring task rule acquisition as well as task performance are likely to overestimate the risk of 56Fe-induced cognitive deficits. Exposure to 15 cGy of 600 MeV/n 56Fe Particles Impairs Rule Acquisition but not Long-Term Memory in the Attentional Set-Shifting Assay.
