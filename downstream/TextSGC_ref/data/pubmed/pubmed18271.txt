BACKGROUND\xa0AND OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia CIAS predict poor functional outcomes but there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for patients with CIAS. Additional cognitive stimulation may be required for pro-cognitive medications to improve efficacy and computerized cognitive training CCT can be used to increase cognitive activity. A trial evaluating the effects of the novel glycine transporter inhibitor BI\xa0425809 compared with placebo on a background of regularly self-administered CCT in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia has commenced and its methodology is described here. Evaluation of the Efficacy of BI 425809 Pharmacotherapy in Patients with Schizophrenia Receiving Computerized Cognitive Training: Methodology for a Double-blind Randomized Parallel-group Trial.
