Skeletal bone age assessment is a common clinical practice to investigate endocrinology and genetic and growth disorders of children. However clinical interpretation and bone age analyses are time-consuming labor intensive and often subject to inter-observer variability. This advocates the need of a fully automated method for bone age assessment. We propose a regression convolutional neural network CNN to automatically assess the pediatric bone age from hand radiograph. Our network is specifically trained to place more attention to those bone age related regions in the X-ray images. Specifically we first adopt the attention module to process all images and generate the coarse/fine attention maps as inputs for the regression network. Then the regression CNN follows the supervision of the dynamic attention loss during training; thus it can estimate the bone age of the hard or "outlier" images more accurately. The experimental results show that our method achieves an average discrepancy of 5.2-5.3 months between clinical and automatic bone age evaluations on two large datasets. In conclusion we propose a fully automated deep learning solution to process X-ray images of the hand for bone age assessment with the accuracy comparable to human experts but with much better efficiency.
