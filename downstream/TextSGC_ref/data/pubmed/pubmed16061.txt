For a natural social human-robot interaction it is essential for a robot to learn the human-like social skills. However learning such skills is notoriously hard due to the limited availability of direct instructions from people to teach a robot. In this paper we propose an intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning framework in which an agent gets the intrinsic motivation-based rewards through the action-conditional predictive model. By using the proposed method the robot learned the social skills from the human-robot interaction experiences gathered in the real uncontrolled environments. The results indicate that the robot not only acquired human-like social skills but also took more human-like decisions on a test dataset than a robot which received direct rewards for the task achievement. Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction in the real-world.
