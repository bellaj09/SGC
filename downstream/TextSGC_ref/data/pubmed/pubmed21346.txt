Brain computer interfaces BCI for the rehabilitation of motor impairments exploit sensorimotor rhythms SMR in the electroencephalogram EEG. However the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session intra-subject variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.
