"Time away from surgical practice can lead to skills decay. Research residents are thought to be prone to skills decay given their limited experience and reduced exposure to clinical activities during their research training years. This study takes a cross-sectional approach to assess differences in residents skills at the beginning and end of their research years using virtual reality. We hypothesized that research residents will have measurable decay in psychomotor skills when evaluated using virtual reality." Can Virtual Reality Be Used to Track Skills Decay During the Research Years?
