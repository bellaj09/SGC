Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LC-MS-based metabolomics has emerged as a valuable tool for biological discovery capable of assaying thousands of diverse chemical entities in a single biospecimen. Processing of nontargeted LC-MS spectral data requires identification and isolation of true spectral features from the random false noise peaks that comprise a significant portion of total signals using inexact peak selection algorithms and time-consuming visual inspection of data. To increase the fidelity and speed of data processing herein we establish optimize and evaluate a machine learning pipeline employing deep neural networks as well as a simpler multiple logistic regression model for classification of spectral features from nontargeted LC-MS metabolomics data. Machine learning-based approaches were found to remove up to 90% of false peaks from complex nontargeted LC-MS data sets without reducing true positive signals and exhibit excellent reproducibility across multiple data sets. Application of machine learning for nontargeted LC-MS-based peak selection provides for robust and scalable peak classification and data filtering enabling handling and processing of large scale complex metabolomics data sets.
