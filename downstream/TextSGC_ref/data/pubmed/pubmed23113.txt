A novel hybrid brain-computer interface BCI based on the electroencephalogram EEG signal which consists of a motor imagery- MI- based online interactive brain-controlled switch "teeth clenching" state detector and a steady-state visual evoked potential- SSVEP- based BCI was proposed to provide multidimensional BCI control. MI-based BCI was used as single-pole double throw brain switch SPDTBS. By combining the SPDTBS with 4-class SSEVP-based BCI movement of robotic arm was controlled in three-dimensional 3D space. In addition muscle artifact EMG of "teeth clenching" condition recorded from EEG signal was detected and employed as interrupter which can initialize the statement of SPDTBS. Real-time writing task was implemented to verify the reliability of the proposed noninvasive hybrid EEG-EMG-BCI. Eight subjects participated in this study and succeeded to manipulate a robotic arm in 3D space to write some English letters. The mean decoding accuracy of writing task was 0.93  0.03. Four subjects achieved the optimal criteria of writing the word "HI" which is the minimum movement of robotic arm directions 15 steps. Other subjects had needed to take from 2 to 4 additional steps to finish the whole process. These results suggested that our proposed hybrid noninvasive EEG-EMG-BCI was robust and efficient for real-time multidimensional robotic arm control.
