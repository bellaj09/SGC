This paper presents a comprehensive effort to establish a structural mouse connectome using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging coupled with connectivity analysis tools. This work lays the foundation for imaging-based structural connectomics of the mouse brain potentially facilitating a whole-brain network analysis to quantify brain changes in connectivity during development as well as deviations from it related to genetic effects. A connectomic trajectory of maturation during postnatal ages 2-80 days is presented in the C57BL/6J mouse strain using a whole-brain connectivity analysis followed by investigations based on local and global network features. The global network measures of density global efficiency and modularity demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with age. The regional network metrics namely degree and local efficiency displayed a differential change in the major subcortical structures such as the thalamus and hippocampus and cortical regions such as visual and motor cortex. Finally the connectomes were used to derive an index of "brain connectivity index" which demonstrated a high correlation r = 0.95 with the chronological age indicating that brain connectivity is a good marker of normal age progression hence valuable in detecting subtle deviations from normality caused by genetic environmental or pharmacological manipulations.
