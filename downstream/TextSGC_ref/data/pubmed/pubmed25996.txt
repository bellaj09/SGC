Considerable operative time is expended during the planning shaping and reconfiguring of the cranial vault in the pursuit of symmetry during open craniosynostosis surgery. Computer-aided design and manufacturing has recently been implemented in orthognathic surgery and complex craniomaxillofacial reconstruction as a means of optimizing operative accuracy and efficiency. In this report we highlight our growing experience with this promising modality for the preoperative planning and intraoperative execution of cranial vault remodeling in patients with both simple and complex forms of craniosynostosis. Computer-aided design and manufacturing in craniosynostosis surgery.
