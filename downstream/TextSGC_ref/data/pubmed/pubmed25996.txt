"It is generally assumed that noninvasively-acquired neural signals contain an insufficient level of information for decoding or reconstructing detailed kinematics of natural multi-joint limb movements and hand gestures. Here we review recent findings from our laboratory at the University of Maryland showing that noninvasive scalp electroencephalography EEG or magnetoencephalography MEG can be used to continuously decode the kinematics of 2D center-out drawing unconstrained 3D center-out reaching and 3D finger gesturing. These findings suggest that these far-field extra-cranial neural signals contain rich information about the neural representation of movement at the macroscale and thus these neural representations provide alternative methods for developing noninvasive brain-machine interfaces with wide-ranging clinical relevance and for understanding functional and pathological brain states at various stages of development and aging."
