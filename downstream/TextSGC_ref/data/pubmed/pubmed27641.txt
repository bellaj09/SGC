In the absence of approved treatments to repair damage to the central nervous system the role of neurosurgeons after spinal cord injury SCI often remains confined to spinal cord decompression and vertebral fracture stabilization. However recent advances in bioelectronic medicine are changing this landscape. Multiple neuromodulation therapies that target circuits located in the brain midbrain or spinal cord have been able to improve motor and autonomic functions. The spectrum of implantable brain-computer interface technologies is also expanding at a fast pace and all these neurotechnologies are being progressively embedded within rehabilitation programs in order to augment plasticity of spared circuits and residual projections with training. Here we summarize the impending arrival of bioelectronic medicine in the field of SCI. We also discuss the new role of functional neurosurgeons in neurorestorative interventional medicine a new discipline at the intersection of neurosurgery neuro-engineering and neurorehabilitation. Neurorestorative interventions involving bioelectronic implants after spinal cord injury.
