Brain-computer interfaces BCIs provide a direct communication channel between human brain and output devices. Due to advantages such as non-invasiveness ease of use and low cost electroencephalography EEG is the most popular method for current BCIs. This chapter gives an overview of the current EEG-based BCIs for the main purpose of communication and control. This chapter first provides a taxonomy of the EEG-based BCI systems by categorizing them into three major groups: 1 BCIs based on event-related potentials ERPs 2 BCIs based on sensorimotor rhythms and 3 hybrid BCIs. Next this chapter describes challenges and potential solutions in developing practical BCI systems toward high communication speed convenient system use and low user variation. Then this chapter briefly reviews both medical and non-medical applications of current BCIs. Finally this chapter concludes with a summary of current stage and future perspectives of the EEG-based BCI technology. EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces.
