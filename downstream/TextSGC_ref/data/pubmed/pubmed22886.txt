"The proposed study aims at expanding results from a previous study on mechanisms of change after exposure in virtual reality VR and documenting the impact of adding tactile and haptic feedback. It was predicted that change in the severity of spider phobia according to the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire FSQ would be significantly predicted by change in dysfunctional beliefs toward spiders and self-efficacy over and above the variance explained by a physiological measure of fear during exposure heart rate and presence during the immersion. Participants N\u2009=\u200959 were randomly assigned to the presentation of visual stimuli only visual plus tactile stimuli or visual tactile plus haptic feedback stimuli. A standard multiple regression was conducted to predict change on the FSQ using the following predictors: beliefs about spiders beliefs about ones own behavior when facing spiders perceived self-efficacy disgust presence and heart rate. Only changes in beliefs about spiders and in perceived self-efficacy significantly predicted the reduction in fear of spiders. This result enhances our understanding of the mechanisms involved in exposure conducted in VR. Analyses of variance also show that participants reported statistically significant changes in their clinical condition with little added value to the addition of tactile and haptic feedback. The advantages of tactile and haptic stimulation are questioned at least in the context of only one brief exposure session and the equipment used."
