"Rehabilitation interventions in remote areas are problematic because of distance and available resources. Orthopedic impairments acquired by individuals in remote areas can then lead to permanent disabilities/loss of function because of lack of appropriate rehabilitation. A system being developed by Rutgers and Stanford Universities provides therapy at the patients home with remote monitoring and periodic re-assessment. This telerehabilitation system uses virtual reality and haptic interfaces and a pair of networked PCs. It is intended for rehabilitation of patients with hand elbow knee and ankle impairments. Data from the first patient treated with the telerehabilitation system is encouraging." Virtual reality-based orthopedic telerehabilitation.
