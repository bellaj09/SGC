"WHATS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: A competent urologist should not only have effective technical skills but also other attributes that would make him/her a complete surgeon. These include team-working communication and decision-making skills. Although evidence for effectiveness of simulation exists for individual simulators there is a paucity of evidence for utility and effectiveness of these simulators in training programmes that aims to combine technical and non-technical skills training. This article explains the process of development and validation of a centrally coordinated simulation program Participants - South-East Region Specialist Registrars under the umbrella of the British Association for Urological Surgeons BAUS and the London Deanery. This program incorporated training of both technical synthetic animal and virtual reality models and non-technical skills simulated operating theatres." Development and implementation of centralized simulation training: evaluation of feasibility acceptability and construct validity.
