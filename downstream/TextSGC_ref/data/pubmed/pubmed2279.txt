Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality and finding new treatments is critical. Most cases are mild but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19. Use of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation to treat respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19: A theoretical hypothesis and early clinical experience.
