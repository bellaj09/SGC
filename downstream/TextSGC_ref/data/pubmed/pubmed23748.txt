Minimal access surgery MAS requires additional training in the surgical curriculum as skills needed to perform MAS are quite different from those used in open surgery. Moreover residents do not seem to experience ample opportunity to gain such skills in the current surgical curriculum. Virtual reality VR simulation offers an interesting opportunity to train such skills in a safe supporting environment. As with any new development one should be careful about integrating costly technology into practice before it has been properly validated.This article outlines the requirements for a valid and integrated approach towards the integration of novel VR simulation systems in minimal access surgery. Validation of virtual reality simulators: Key to the successful integration of a novel teaching technology into minimal access surgery.
