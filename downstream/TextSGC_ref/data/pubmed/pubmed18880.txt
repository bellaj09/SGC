This research studies the process of dynamic concision and 3D reconstruction from medical body data using VRML and JavaScript language focuses on how to realize the dynamic concision of 3D medical model built with VRML. The 2D medical digital images firstly are modified and manipulated by 2D image software. Then based on these images 3D mould is built with VRML and JavaScript language. After programming in JavaScript to control 3D model the function of dynamic concision realized by Script node and sensor node in VRML. The 3D reconstruction and concision of body internal organs can be formed in high quality near to those got in traditional methods. By this way with the function of dynamic concision VRML browser can offer better windows of man-computer interaction in real time environment than before. 3D reconstruction and dynamic concision with VRML can be used to meet the requirement for the medical observation of 3D reconstruction and has a promising prospect in the fields of medical image. The dynamic concision for three-dimensional reconstruction of human organ built with virtual reality modeling language VRML.
