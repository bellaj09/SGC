The arguments presented by Espinoza et al. in their paper "Relationship of genetically modified crops with the environment and health of the Costa Rican human population" published in this journal Rev. Biol. Trop. 52: 727-732 2004 are questioned and refuted. The arguments are confronted with evidence offered by scientists and national and international independent organizations around the world e.g. World Health Organization Consumers International Physicians and Scientists for Responsible Application of Science and Technology International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources the Council of the University of Costa Rica and the Independent Science Panel showing the current uncertainty and limitations of science in this area as well as those of proposed and applied biosafety approaches. Environment biodiversity and food security are so important and basic matters that there is need of serious testing particularly when promises seem to be based on environmentally dangerous ideas promoted half a century ago by the so called "green revolution". Debate should continue based on a holistic analysis of facts and with ethical reasoning avoiding emotional positions that can confuse virtual reality with reality. Genetically modified crops: promises and good intentions are not enough refutation to Espinoza et aL 2004 Rev. Biol. Trop. 52 3: 727-732.
