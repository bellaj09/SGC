Computer-assisted surgery has been more and more widely used in craniofacial surgery in recent years. It is useful in many situations: stereolithographic models surgical simulations of osteotomies and bone repositioning and cutting guides and customized implants. The present paper argues that computer-assisted surgery is particularly useful in complex cases such as rare malformations or to address the sequelae of previous surgeries. The various advantages of the technique are emphasized from a surgical and from a teaching standpoint. Virtual 3D planning of osteotomies for craniosynostoses and complex craniofacial malformations.
