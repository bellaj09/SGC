"The majority of neuropsychological tests used to evaluate attention processes in children lack ecological validity. The AULA Nesplora AULA is a continuous performance test developed in a virtual setting very similar to a school classroom. The aim of the present study is to analyze the convergent validity between the AULA and the Continuous Performance Test CPT of Conners. The AULA and CPT were administered correlatively to 57 children aged 6-16 years 26.3% female with average cognitive ability IQ mean = 100.56 SD = 10.38 who had a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Spearman correlations analyses were conducted among the different variables. Significant correlations were observed between both tests in all the analyzed variables omissions commissions reaction time and variability of reaction time including for those measures of the AULA based on different sensorial modalities presentation of distractors and task paradigms. Hence convergent validity between both tests was confirmed. Moreover the AULA showed differences by gender and correlation to Perceptual Reasoning and Working Memory indexes of the WISC-IV supporting the relevance of IQ measures in the understanding of cognitive performance in ADHD. In addition the AULA but not Conners CPT was able to differentiate between ADHD children with and without pharmacological treatment for a wide range of measures related to inattention impulsivity processing speed motor activity and quality of attention focus. Additional measures and advantages of the AULA versus Conners CPT are discussed." "AULA virtual reality test as an attention measure: convergent validity with Conners Continuous Performance Test."
