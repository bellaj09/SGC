"This paper presents a novel three-dimensional 3-D eye movement analysis algorithm for binocular eye tracking within virtual reality VR. The users gaze direction head position and orientation are tracked in order to allow recording of the users fixations within the environment. Although the linear signal analysis approach is itself not new its application to eye movement analysis in three dimensions advances traditional two-dimensional approaches since it takes into account the six degrees of freedom of head movements and is resolution independent. Results indicate that the 3-D eye movement analysis algorithm can successfully be used for analysis of visual process measures in VR. Process measures not only can corroborate performance measures but also can lead to discoveries of the reasons for performance improvements. In particular analysis of users eye movements in VR can potentially lead to further insights into the underlying cognitive processes of VR subjects." 3-D eye movement analysis.
