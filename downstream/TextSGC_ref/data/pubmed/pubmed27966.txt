For brain computer interfaces BCIs which may be valuable in neurorehabilitation brain signals derived from mental activation can be monitored by non-invasive methods such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS. Single-trial classification is important for this purpose and this was the aim of the presented study. In particular we aimed to investigate a combined approach: 1 offline single-trial classification of brain signals derived from a novel wireless fNIRS instrument; 2 to use motor imagery MI as mental task thereby discriminating between MI signals in response to different tasks complexities i.e. simple and complex MI tasks. Single-trial classification of motor imagery differing in task complexity: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.
