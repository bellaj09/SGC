"Traditional automatic navigation methods for bio-robots are constrained to configured environments and thus cant be applied to tasks in unknown environments. With no consideration of bio-robots own innate living ability and treating bio-robots in the same way as mechanical robots those methods neglect the intelligence behavior of animals. This paper proposes a novel ratbot automatic navigation method in unknown environments using only reward stimulation and distance measurement. By utilizing rats habit of thigmotaxis and its reward-seeking behavior this method is able to incorporate rats intrinsic intelligence of obstacle avoidance and path searching into navigation. Experiment results show that this method works robustly and can successfully navigate the ratbot to a target in the unknown environment. This work might put a solid base for application of ratbots and also has significant implication of automatic navigation for other bio-robots as well."
