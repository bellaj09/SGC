Astronauts may have difficulty adhering to exercise regimens at vigorous intensity levels during long space missions. Vigorous exercise is important for aerobic and musculoskeletal health during space missions and afterwards. A key impediment to maintaining vigorous exercise is motivation. Finding ways to motivate astronauts to exercise at levels necessary to mitigate reductions in musculoskeletal health and aerobic capacity have not been explored. The focus of Simulated Partners and Collaborative Exercise SPACE is to use recently documented motivation gains in task groups to heighten the exercise experience for participants similar in age and fitness to astronauts for vigorous exercise over a 6-month exercise regimen. A secondary focus is to determine the most effective features in simulated exercise partners for enhancing enjoyment self-efficacy and social connectedness. The aims of the project are to 1 Create software-generated SG exercise partners and interface software with a cycle ergometer; 2 Pilot test design features of SG partners within a video exercise game exergame and 3 Test whether exercising with an SG partner over 24-week time period compared to exercising alone leads to greater work effort aerobic capacity muscle strength exercise adherence and enhanced psychological parameters.
