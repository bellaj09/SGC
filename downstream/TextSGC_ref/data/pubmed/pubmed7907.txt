In psychiatry we often speak of constructing "models." Here we try to make sense of what such a claim might mean starting with the most fundamental question: "What is and isn\t a model?" We then discuss in a concrete measurable sense what it means for a model to be useful. In so doing we first identify the added value that a computational model can provide in the context of accuracy and power. We then present limitations of standard statistical methods and provide suggestions for how we can expand the explanatory power of our analyses by reconceptualizing statistical models as dynamical systems. Finally we address the problem of model building-suggesting ways in which computational psychiatry can escape the potential for cognitive biases imposed by classical hypothesis-driven research exploiting deep systems-level information contained within neuroimaging data to advance our understanding of psychiatric neuroscience.
