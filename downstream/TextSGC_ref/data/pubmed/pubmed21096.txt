Clinical neuropsychologists have long underutilized computer technologies for neuropsychological assessment. Given the rapid advances in technology e.g. virtual reality; tablets; iPhones and the increased accessibility in the past decade there is an on-going need to identify optimal specifications for advanced technologies while minimizing potential sources of error. Herein we discuss concerns raised by a joint American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology/National Academy of Neuropsychology position paper. Moreover we proffer parameters for the development and use of advanced technologies in neuropsychological assessments. Practice parameters facilitating adoption of advanced technologies for enhancing neuropsychological assessment paradigms.
