Over the past decade simulation-based training has come to the foreground as an efficient method for training and assessment of surgical skills in minimal invasive surgery. Box-trainers and virtual reality VR simulators have been introduced in the teaching curricula and have substituted to some extent the traditional model of training based on animals or cadavers. Augmented reality AR is a new technology that allows blending of VR elements and real objects within a real-world scene. In this paper we present a novel AR simulator for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. A novel augmented reality simulator for skills assessment in minimal invasive surgery.
