"Estimating the number of people in highly clustered crowd scenes is an extremely challenging task on account of serious occlusion and non-uniformity distribution in one crowd image. Traditional works on crowd counting take advantage of different CNN like networks to regress crowd density map and further predict the count. In contrast we investigate a simple but valid deep learning model that concentrates on accurately predicting the density map and simultaneously training a density level classifier to relax parameters of the network to prevent dangerous stampede with a smart camera. First a combination of atrous and fractional stride convolutional neural network CAFN is proposed to deliver larger receptive fields and reduce the loss of details during down-sampling by using dilated kernels. Second the expanded architecture is offered to not only precisely regress the density map but also classify the density level of the crowd in the meantime MTCAFN multiple tasks CAFN for both regression and classification. Third experimental results demonstrated on four datasets Shanghai Tech A MAE = 88.1 and B MAE = 18.8 WorldExpo10average MAE = 8.2 NS UCF_CC_50MAE = 303.2 prove our proposed method can deliver effective performance."
