The primary focus of rehabilitation for individuals with loss of upper limb movement as a result of acquired brain injury is the relearning of specific motor skills and daily tasks. This relearning is essential because the loss of upper limb movement often results in a reduced quality of life. Although rehabilitation strives to take advantage of neuroplastic processes during recovery results of traditional approaches to upper limb rehabilitation have not entirely met this goal. In contrast enriched training tasks simulated with a wide range of low- to high-end virtual reality-based simulations can be used to provide meaningful repetitive practice together with salient feedback thereby maximizing neuroplastic processes via motor learning and motor recovery. Such enriched virtual environments have the potential to optimize motor learning by manipulating practice conditions that explicitly engage motivational cognitive motor control and sensory feedback-based learning mechanisms. The objectives of this article are to review motor control and motor learning principles to discuss how they can be exploited by virtual reality training environments and to provide evidence concerning current applications for upper limb motor recovery. The limitations of the current technologies with respect to their effectiveness and transfer of learning to daily life tasks also are discussed.
