The aim of this study was to develop a fully automated deep learning approach for identification of the pectoral muscle on mediolateral oblique MLO view mammograms and evaluate its performance in comparison to our previously developed texture-field orientation TFO method using conventional image feature analysis. Pectoral muscle segmentation is an important step for automated image analyses such as breast density or parenchymal pattern classification lesion detection and multiview correlation. Automated pectoral muscle identification on MLO-view mammograms: Comparison of deep neural network to conventional computer vision.
