The current deluge of newly identified RNA transcripts presents a singular opportunity for improved assessment of coding potential a cornerstone of genome annotation and for machine-driven discovery of biological knowledge. While traditional feature-based methods for RNA classification are limited by current scientific knowledge deep learning methods can independently discover complex biological rules in the data de novo. We trained a gated recurrent neural network RNN on human messenger RNA mRNA and long noncoding RNA lncRNA sequences. Our model mRNA RNN mRNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods at predicting protein-coding potential despite being trained with less data and with no prior concept of what features define mRNAs. To understand what mRNN learned we probed the network and uncovered several context-sensitive codons highly predictive of coding potential. Our results suggest that gated RNNs can learn complex and long-range patterns in full-length human transcripts making them ideal for performing a wide range of difficult classification tasks and most importantly for harvesting new biological insights from the rising flood of sequencing data.
