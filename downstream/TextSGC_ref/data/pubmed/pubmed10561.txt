In recent years significant advancements have taken place in human activity recognition using various machine learning approaches. However feature engineering have dominated conventional methods involving the difficult process of optimal feature selection. This problem has been mitigated by using a novel methodology based on deep learning framework which automatically extracts the useful features and reduces the computational cost. As a proof of concept we have attempted to design a generalized model for recognition of three fundamental movements of the human forearm performed in daily life where data is collected from four different subjects using a single wrist worn accelerometer sensor. The validation of the proposed model is done with different pre-processing and noisy data condition which is evaluated using three possible methods. The results show that our proposed methodology achieves an average recognition rate of 99.8% as opposed to conventional methods based on K-means clustering linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine.
