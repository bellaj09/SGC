"Long calibration time hinders the feasibility of brain-computer interfaces BCI. If other subjects data were used for training the classifier BCI-based neurofeedback practice could start without the initial calibration. Here we compare methods for inter-subject decoding of left- vs. right-hand motor imagery MI from MEG and EEG. Six methods were tested on data involving MEG and EEG measurements of healthy participants. Inter-subject decoders were trained on subjects showing good within-subject accuracy and tested on all subjects including poor performers. Three methods were based on Common Spatial Patterns CSP and three others on logistic regression with l1 - or l21 -norm regularization. The decoding accuracy was evaluated using 1 MI and 2 passive movements PM for training separately for MEG and EEG. With MI training the best accuracies across subjects mean 70.6% for MEG 67.7% for EEG were obtained using multi-task learning MTL with logistic regression and l21-norm regularization. MEG yielded slightly better average accuracies than EEG. With PM training none of the inter-subject methods yielded above chance level 58.7% accuracy. In conclusion MTL and training with other subjects MI is efficient for inter-subject decoding of MI. Passive movements of other subjects are likely suboptimal for training the MI classifiers."
