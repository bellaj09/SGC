Obstructive Sleep Apnea OSA is characterized by repetitive episodes of airflow reduction hypopnea or cessation apnea which as a prevalent sleep disorder can cause people to stop breathing for 10 to 30 seconds at a time and lead to serious problems such as daytime fatigue impaired memory and depression. This work intends to explore automatic detection of OSA events with 1-second annotation based on blood oxygen saturation oronasal airflow and ribcage and abdomen movements. Deep Learning DL technology specifically Convolutional Neural Network CNN is employed as a feature detector to learn the characteristics of the highorder correlation among visible data and corresponding labels. A fully-connected layer in the last stage of the CNN is connected to the output layer and constructs the desired number of outputs for sleep apnea events classification. A leave-one-out cross-validation has been conducted on the PhysioNet Sleep Database provided by St. Vincents University Hospital and University College Dublin and an average accuracy of $79 .61$% across normal hypopnea and apnea classes is achieved.
