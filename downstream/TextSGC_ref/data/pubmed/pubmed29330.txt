Directly using brain signals to drive a vehicle may not only help persons with disabilities to regain driving ability but also provide a new alternative way for healthy people to control a vehicle. In this paper we propose a new longitudinal control system based on electroencephalogram signals for brain-controlled vehicles BCVs by combining a user interface a brain-computer interface BCI system and a longitudinal control module. Driver-in-the-loop experiments were conducted by using two driving tests i.e. the destination-approaching and car-following tests with different subjects under two control conditions i.e. the brain and manual control conditions. Experimental results show the feasibility of alone using brain signals to continuously perform the longitudinal control of a vehicle at a relatively high speed at least for some users. This paper not only promotes the development of BCVs but also provides some insights into the research on how to apply BCIs to control other high-speed dynamic systems.
