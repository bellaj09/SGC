The principle of \divide-and-conquer\ the decomposition of a complex task into simpler subtasks each learned by a separate module has been proposed as a computational strategy during learning. We explore the possibility that the human motor system uses such a modular decomposition strategy to learn the visuomotor map the relationship between visual inputs and motor outputs. Using a virtual reality system subjects were exposed to opposite prism-like visuomotor remappings-discrepancies between actual and visually perceived hand locations- for movements starting from two distinct locations. Despite this conflicting pairing between visual and motor space subjects learned the two starting-point-dependent visuomotor mappings and the generalization of this learning to intermediate starting locations demonstrated an interpolation of the two learned maps. This interpolation was a weighted average of the two learned visuomotor mappings with the weighting sigmoidally dependent on starting location a prediction made by a computational model of modular learning known as the "mixture of experts". These results provide evidence that the brain may employ a modular decomposition strategy during learning. Modular decomposition in visuomotor learning.
