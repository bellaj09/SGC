Liquid-based cytology LBC is a reliable automated technique for the screening of Papanicolaou Pap smear data. It is an effective technique for collecting a majority of the cervical cells and aiding cytopathologists in locating abnormal cells. Most methods published in the research literature rely on accurate cell segmentation as a prior which remains challenging due to a variety of factors e.g. stain consistency presence of clustered cells etc. We propose a method for automatic classification of cervical slide images through generation of labeled cervical patch data and extracting deep hierarchical features by fine-tuning convolution neural networks as well as a novel graph-based cell detection approach for cellular level evaluation. The results show that the proposed pipeline can classify images of both single cell and overlapping cells. The VGG-19 model is found to be the best at classifying the cervical cytology patch data with 95 % accuracy under precision-recall curve.
