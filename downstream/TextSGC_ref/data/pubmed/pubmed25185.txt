The P300 event-related potential is a well-known pattern in the electroencephalogram EEG. This kind of brain signal is used for many different brain-computer interface BCI applications e.g. spellers environmental controllers web browsers or for painting. In recent times BCI systems are mature enough to leave the laboratories to be used by the end-users namely severely disabled people. Therefore new challenges arise and the systems should be implemented and evaluated according to user-centered design USD guidelines. We developed and implemented a new system that utilizes the P300 pattern to compose music. Our Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition device the P300-based BCI and the music composing software. Seventeen musical participants and one professional composer performed a copy-spelling a copy-composing and a free-composing task with the system. According to the USD guidelines we investigated the efficiency the effectiveness and subjective criteria in terms of satisfaction enjoyment frustration and attractiveness. The musical participants group achieved high average accuracies: 88.24% copy-spelling 88.58% copy-composing and 76.51% free-composing. The professional composer achieved also high accuracies: 100% copy-spelling 93.62% copy-composing and 98.20% free-composing. General results regarding the subjective criteria evaluation were that the participants enjoyed the usage of the Brain Composing system and were highly satisfied with the system. Showing very positive results with healthy people in this study this was the first step towards a music composing system for severely disabled people. Composing only by thought: Novel application of the P300 brain-computer interface.
