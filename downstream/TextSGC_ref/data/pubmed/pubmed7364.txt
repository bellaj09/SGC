We present a novel deep-learning-based approach for one-class transfer learning in which labeled data from an unrelated task is used for feature learning in one-class classification. The proposed method operates on top of a convolutional neural network CNN of choice and produces descriptive features while maintaining a low intra-class variance in the feature space for the given class. For this purpose two loss functions compactness loss and descriptiveness loss are proposed along with a parallel CNN architecture. A template matching-based framework is introduced to facilitate the testing process. Extensive experiments on publicly available anomaly detection novelty detection and mobile active authentication datasets show that the proposed deep one-class DOC classification method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.
