The possibility of a purely instrumental investigation of the sensory characteristics of human in the real time scale has been shown using an analyzer of tonal hearing as an example. In accordance with the previously developed approach the mean-square errors of the deviation of the instantaneous frequency of tonal sounds from its average value upon their vocal reproduction by persons being tested as well as upon their reproduction by a special electronic sound generator requiring a continuous comprehended regulation for maintaining the wanted frequency were chosen as these characteristics. It was found that the mean-square deviation of the current reproducible frequency linearly depends on the average frequency of the reproducible tonal sound. The method can be used without radical changes for studying the characteristics of human sensory analyzers with the use of stimuli of other modalities to control the state of the sensory sphere of the human operator to solve the problems of the synthesis of human--machine interfaces and to construct "virtual reality" systems. Quantitative estimation of the perception of the frequency of tonal sounds by human.
