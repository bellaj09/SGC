We present the performances of our mathematical deep learning MathDL models for D3R Grand Challenge 4 GC4. This challenge involves pose prediction affinity ranking and free energy estimation for beta secretase 1 BACE as well as affinity ranking and free energy estimation for Cathepsin S CatS. We have developed advanced mathematics namely differential geometry algebraic graph and/or algebraic topology to accurately and efficiently encode high dimensional physical/chemical interactions into scalable low-dimensional rotational and translational invariant representations. These representations are integrated with deep learning models such as generative adversarial networks GAN and convolutional neural networks CNN for pose prediction and energy evaluation respectively. Overall our MathDL models achieved the top place in pose prediction for BACE ligands in Stage 1a. Moreover our submissions obtained the highest Spearman correlation coefficient on the affinity ranking of 460 CatS compounds and the smallest centered root mean square error on the free energy set of 39 CatS molecules. It is worthy to mention that our method on docking pose predictions has significantly improved from our previous ones. MathDL: mathematical deep learning for D3R Grand Challenge 4.
