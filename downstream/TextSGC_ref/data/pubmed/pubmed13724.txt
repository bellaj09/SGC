Melaka Manipal Medical College Manipal Campus; Manipal Karnataka India conducts the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program for which the admission intakes are during the months of March and September. The present study was undertaken to study the differences in learning approaches to physiology of undergraduate medical students in a partially problem-based learning PBL- and non-PBL-oriented curriculum. PBL was introduced as a curricular reform for the September 2006 batch of students partially PBL group whereas it was not incorporated for the March 2006 batch of students non-PBL group. Learning approaches to physiology of both groups of students were compared using the short inventory of approaches to learning. Mean scores for deep and strategic approaches were found to be significantly higher for the partially PBL group compared with the non-PBL group. The results of the present study support the earlier observation that PBL promotes a deep approach to learning. Learning approaches of undergraduate medical students to physiology in a non-PBL- and partially PBL-oriented curriculum.
