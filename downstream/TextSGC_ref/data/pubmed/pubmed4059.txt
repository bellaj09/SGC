Diabetes mellitus DM is associated with deficits across multiple cognitive domains. The observed impairments in cognitive function are hypothesized to be subserved by alterations in brain structure and function. Several lines of evidence indicate that alterations in glial integrity and function as well as abnormal synchrony within brain circuits and associated networks are observed in adults with DM. Microangiopathy and alterations in insulin homeostasis appear to be principal effector systems although a unitary explanation subsuming the complex etiopathology of white matter in DM is unavailable. A contemporary model of disease pathophysiology for several mental disorders including but not limited to mood disorders posits abnormalities in the synchronization of cellular systems in circuits. The observation that similar abnormalities occur in diabetic populations provides the basis for hypothesizing the convergence of pathoetiological factors. Herein we propose that abnormal structure function and chemical composition as well as synchrony within and between circuits is an accompaniment of DM and is shared in common with several mental disorders.
