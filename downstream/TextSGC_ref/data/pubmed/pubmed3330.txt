In recent years the study of the human connectome i.e. of statistical relationships between non spatially contiguous neurophysiological events in the human brain has been enormously fuelled by technological advances in high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI as well as by coordinated world wide data-collection efforts like the Human Connectome Project HCP. In this context Granger Causality GC approaches have recently been employed to incorporate information about the directionality of the influence exerted by a brain region on another. However while fluctuations in the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent BOLD signal at rest also contain important information about the physiological processes that underlie neurovascular coupling and associations between disjoint brain regions so far all connectivity estimation frameworks have focused on central tendencies hence completely disregarding so-called in-variance causality i.e. the directed influence of the volatility of one signal on the volatility of another. In this paper we develop a framework for simultaneous estimation of both in-mean and in-variance causality in complex networks. We validate our approach using synthetic data from complex ensembles of coupled nonlinear oscillators and successively employ HCP data to provide the very first estimate of the in-variance connectome of the human brain. Simultaneous estimation of the in-mean and in-variance causal connectomes of the human brain.
