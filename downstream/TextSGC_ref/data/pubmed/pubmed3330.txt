"Parkinsons Disease PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder assumed to involve different areas of CNS and PNS. Thus Diffusion Tensor Imaging DTI is used to examine the areas engaged in PD neurodegeneration. In the present study we computed average tract length and fiber volume as a measure of white matter integrity and adopted Network Based Statistics NBS to conduct group analyses between age- and gender-matched PD patients and healthy control connectivity matrices. NBS is a powerful statistical tool that utilizes the presence of every link in connectivity matrices and controls family wise error rates in weak sense. The major regions with significantly reduced interconnecting fiber volume or average tract length were cingulum temporal lobe frontal lobe parahippocampus hippocampus olfactory lobe and occipital lobe." A statistical approach in human brain connectome of Parkinson Disease in elderly people using Network Based Statistics.
