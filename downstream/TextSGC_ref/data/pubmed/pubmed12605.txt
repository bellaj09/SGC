The pathological bases for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus NPH have not been elucidated. However the symptoms may indicate dysfunction of subcortical regions. Previously volume reductions of subcortical deep grey matter SDGM structures have been observed in NPH patients. The present study used automated segmentation methods to investigate whether SDGM structure volumes are associated with cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures. Structural correlates of cognitive impairment in normal pressure hydrocephalus.
