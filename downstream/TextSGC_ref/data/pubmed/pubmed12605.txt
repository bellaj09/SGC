Artificial intelligence AI using machine learning techniques will change healthcare as we know it. While healthcare AI applications are currently trailing behind popular AI applications such as personalized web-based advertising the pace of research and deployment is picking up and about to become disruptive. Overcoming challenges such as patient and public support transparency over the legal basis for healthcare data use privacy preservation technical challenges related to accessing large-scale data from healthcare systems not designed for Big Data analysis and deployment of AI in routine clinical practice will be crucial. Cardiac imaging and imaging of other body parts is likely to be at the frontier for the development of applications as pattern recognition and machine learning are a significant strength of AI with practical links to image processing. Many opportunities in cardiac imaging exist where AI will impact patients medical staff hospitals commissioners and thus the entire healthcare system. This perspective article will outline our vision for AI in cardiac imaging with examples of potential applications challenges and some lessons learnt in recent years. Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Cardiac Imaging-Opportunities and Challenges.
