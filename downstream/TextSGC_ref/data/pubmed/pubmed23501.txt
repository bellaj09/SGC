"Relatively little is known about the influence of psychosocial factors such as familial role modeling and social network on the development and maintenance of childhood obesity. We investigated peer selection using an immersive virtual reality environment. In a virtual schoolyard children were confronted with normal weight and overweight avatars either eating or playing. Fifty-seven children aged 7-13 participated. Interpersonal distance to the avatars childs BMI self-perception eating behavior and parental BMI were assessed. Parental BMI was the strongest predictor for the childrens minimal distance to the avatars. Specifically a higher mothers BMI was associated with greater interpersonal distance and children approached closer to overweight eating avatars. A higher fathers BMI was associated with a lower interpersonal distance to the avatars. These children approached normal weight playing and overweight eating avatar peers closest. The importance of parental BMI for the childs social approach/avoidance behavior can be explained through social modeling mechanisms. Differential effects of paternal and maternal BMI might be due to gender specific beauty ideals. Interventions to promote social interaction with peer groups could foster weight stabilization or weight loss in children."
