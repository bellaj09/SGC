A review of the literature was conducted to understand and identify how eMental health has been used in resource-limited settings in general. PubMed Ovid Medline and Web of Science were searched.

Technology was applied to enhance service delivery n\u202f=\u202f32 behavior change communication n\u202f=\u202f26 and data collection n\u202f=\u202f8 and specifically dealt with adherence n\u202f=\u202f7 ecological momentary assessments n\u202f=\u202f7 well-being promotion n\u202f=\u202f5 education n\u202f=\u202f8 telemedicine n\u202f=\u202f28 machine learning n\u202f=\u202f5 and games n\u202f=\u202f2.
