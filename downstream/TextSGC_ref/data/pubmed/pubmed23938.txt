Of the available training methods for emergency responders including other methods based on computer technology virtual reality video game training with haptics tactile features will be shown to provide the most effective transfer of skills to real-world emergency situations providing a model for the development of new training products for combat medics and civilian first responders. This paper aims to provide a methodological case study of haptics use in medical training programs and highlight achievements in terms of performance. Review of these cases show that the addition of haptics to an existing simulation-based training program increases user performance in terms of completion time error rates and learning rate. With this case study haptics can be further incorporated into training programs designed for military combat medics. Methodology case study of the application of haptics to combat medic training programs.
