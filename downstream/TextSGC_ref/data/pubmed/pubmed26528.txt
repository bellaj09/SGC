"Do movements made with an intracortical BCI iBCI have the same movement time properties as able-bodied movements? Able-bodied movement times typically obey Fitts law: Formula: see text where MT is movement time D is target distance R is target radius and Formula: see text are parameters. Fitts law expresses two properties of natural movement that would be ideal for iBCIs to restore: 1 that movement times are insensitive to the absolute scale of the task since movement time depends only on the ratio Formula: see text and 2 that movements have a large dynamic range of accuracy since movement time is logarithmically proportional to Formula: see text."
