Visual evoked potentials VEPs are of great concern in cognitive and clinical neuroscience as well as in the recent research field of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. In this study a chirp-modulated stimulation was employed to serve as a novel type of visual stimulus. Based on our empirical study the chirp stimuli visual evoked potential Chirp-VEP preserved frequency features of the chirp stimulus analogous to the steady state evoked potential SSVEP and therefore it can be regarded as a generalization of SSVEP. Specifically we first investigated the characteristics of the Chirp-VEP in the time-frequency domain and the fractional domain via fractional Fourier transform. We also proposed a group delay technique to derive the apparent latency from Chirp-VEP. Results on EEG data showed that our approach outperformed the traditional SSVEP-based method in efficiency and ease of apparent latency estimation. For the recruited six subjects the average apparent latencies ranged from 100 to 130 ms. Finally we implemented a BCI system with six targets to validate the feasibility of Chirp-VEP as a potential candidate in the field of BCIs.
