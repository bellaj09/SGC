The capacity to process complex dynamic scenes is of critical importance in real life. For instance traveling through a crowd while avoiding collisions and maintaining orientation and good motor control requires fluent and continuous perceptual-cognitive processing. It is well documented that effects of healthy aging can influence perceptual-cognitive processes Faubert 2002 and that the efficiency of such processes can improve with training even for older adults Richards et al. 2006. Here we assess the capacity of older participants to improve their tracking speed thresholds in a dynamic virtual reality environment. Results show that this capacity is significantly affected by healthy aging but that perceptual-cognitive training can significantly reduce age-related effects in older individuals who show an identical learning function to younger healthy adults. Data support the notion that learning in healthy older persons is maintained for processing complex dynamic scenes. Healthy older observers show equivalent perceptual-cognitive training benefits to young adults for multiple object tracking.
