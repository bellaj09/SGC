Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are a promising technology for restoring motor ability to paralyzed patients. Spiking-based BCIs have successfully been used in clinical trials to control multi-degree-of-freedom robotic devices. Current implementations of these devices require a lengthy spike-sorting step which is an obstacle to moving this technology from the lab to the clinic. A viable alternative is to avoid spike-sorting treating all threshold crossings of the voltage waveform on an electrode as coming from one putative neuron. It is not known however how much decoding information might be lost by ignoring spike identity. To sort or not to sort: the impact of spike-sorting on neural decoding performance.
