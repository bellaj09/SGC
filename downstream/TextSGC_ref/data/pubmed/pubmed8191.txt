"Debate has been shown to develop critical thinking skills enhance communication and encourage teamwork in a range of different disciplines including nursing. The objective of this study was to explore students perceptions of the educational value of debate. A semi-structured focus group was conducted with 13 undergraduate Operating Department Practice students following a debate on the opt-out system of organ donation. Transcripts were analysed thematically identifying three main themes that described the students perceptions of the debate. These were: 1 openness to diverse viewpoints; 2 developing non-technical skills and 3 encouraging deep learning. The analysis showed participants perceived debate to be a valuable educational method that enhanced their learning. Engaging in debate encouraged students to critically reflect on their prior beliefs about organ donation-in some cases leading them to reconsider their original position. The findings from this study suggest that debate can be a valuable pedagogical tool to incorporate into healthcare education. Future research should consider the use of debate to develop non-technical skills that have utility in healthcare." "Students perceptions of debating as a learning strategy: A qualitative study."
