Use of Motor Imagery in EEG signals is gaining importance to develop Brain Computer Interface BCI applications in various fields ranging from bio-medical to entertainment. Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern FBCSP algorithm is a promising feature extraction technique to deal with subject-specific behavior in Motor Imagery classification. Using FBCSP on EEG we have developed an accurate but less computationally expensive approach by making use of Time Domain Parameters TDP and Band Power BP features to form a combined feature set. The novelty of our approach is also the use of optimal time segmentation to overcome non-stationary state behavior of Event-Related Desynchronization ERD and Event-Related Synchronization ERS over time. We analyzed the impact of parameter variations on classification accuracy and achieved 0.59 mean kappa value for Dataset 2a BCI competition IV the highest reported for FBCSP approaches along with the lowest inter-subject variation. FBCSP-based Multi-class Motor Imagery Classification using BP and TDP features.
