Genome-wide association analyses have uncovered multiple genomic regions associated with T2D but identification of the causal variants at these remains a challenge. There is growing interest in the potential of deep learning models - which predict epigenome features from DNA sequence - to support inference concerning the regulatory effects of disease-associated variants. Here we evaluate the advantages of training convolutional neural network CNN models on a broad set of epigenomic features collected in a single disease-relevant tissue - pancreatic islets in the case of type 2 diabetes T2D - as opposed to models trained on multiple human tissues. We report convergence of CNN-based metrics of regulatory function with conventional approaches to variant prioritization - genetic fine-mapping and regulatory annotation enrichment. We demonstrate that CNN-based analyses can refine association signals at T2D-associated loci and provide experimental validation for one such signal. We anticipate that these approaches will become routine in downstream analyses of GWAS. Deep learning models predict regulatory variants in pancreatic islets and refine type 2 diabetes association signals.
