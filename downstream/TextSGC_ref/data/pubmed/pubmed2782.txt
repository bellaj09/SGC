A recent article by Gu et\xa0al. Nat. Commun. 6 2015 proposed to characterize brain networks quantified using anatomical diffusion imaging in terms of their "controllability" drawing on concepts and methods of control theory. They reported that brain activity is controllable from a single node and that the topology of brain networks provides an explanation for the types of control roles that different regions play in the brain. In this work we first briefly review the framework of control theory applied to complex networks. We then show contrasting results on brain controllability through the analysis of five different datasets and numerical simulations. We find that brain networks are not controllable in a statistical significant way by one single region. Additionally we show that random null models with no biological resemblance to brain network architecture produce the same type of relationship observed by Gu et\xa0al. between the average/modal controllability and weighted degree. Finally we find that resting state networks defined with fMRI cannot be attributed specific control roles. In summary our study highlights some warning and caveats in the brain controllability framework. Warnings and caveats in brain controllability.
