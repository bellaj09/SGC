"The paper presents an ergonomic analysis carried out in the early phases of an R&D project. The purpose was to investigate the functioning of todays Automotive Service Technicians ASTs training in order to inform the design of an Augmented Reality AR teaching aid. The first part of the paper presents a literature review of some major problems encountered by ASTs today. The benefits of AR as technological aid are also introduced. Then the methodology and the results of two case studies are presented. The first study is based on interviews with trainers and trainees; the second one on observations in real training settings. The results support the assumption that todays ASTs training could be regarded as a community-of-practice CoP. Therefore AR could be useful as a collaboration tool offering a shared virtual representation of real vehicles parts which are normally invisible unless dismantled e.g. the parts of a hydraulic automatic transmission. We conclude on the methods and the technologies to support the automotive CoP."
