Previous approaches using deep learning DL algorithms to classify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs have been limited by the requirement for human labeling of a reference training set. We propose a new approach using quantitative spectral-domain SD OCT data to train a DL algorithm to quantify glaucomatous structural damage on optic disc photographs. From Machine to Machine: An OCT-Trained Deep Learning Algorithm for Objective Quantification of Glaucomatous Damage in Fundus Photographs.
