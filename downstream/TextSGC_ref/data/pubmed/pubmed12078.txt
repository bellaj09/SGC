Both interclass variances and intraclass similarities are crucial for improving the classification performance of discriminative dictionary learning DDL algorithms. However existing DDL methods often ignore the combination between the interclass and intraclass properties of dictionary atoms and coding coefficients. To address this problem in this paper we propose a discriminative Fisher embedding dictionary learning DFEDL algorithm that simultaneously establishes Fisher embedding models on learned atoms and coefficients. Specifically we first construct a discriminative Fisher atom embedding model by exploring the Fisher criterion of the atoms which encourages the atoms of the same class to reconstruct the corresponding training samples as much as possible. At the same time a discriminative Fisher coefficient embedding model is formulated by imposing the Fisher criterion on the profiles row vectors of the coding coefficient matrix and coding coefficients which forces the coding coefficient matrix to become a block-diagonal matrix. Since the profiles can indicate which training samples are represented by the corresponding atoms the proposed two discriminative Fisher embedding models can alternatively and interactively promote the discriminative capabilities of the learned dictionary and coding coefficients. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DFEDL algorithm achieves superior performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms on both hand-crafted and deep learning-based features.
