"Neuroimaging-derived markers are used to model post-stroke impairment. Among these lesion size corticospinal-tract lesion-load CST-LL and resting-state functional-connectivity rs-FC have been correlated with impairment. It has been shown that the sensory cortex S1 is associated with motor learning and is essential for post-stroke recovery; yet stroke-induced changes in S1 connectivity alone are yet to be investigated. We aim to determine whether interhemispheric rs-FC could be used to refine imaging models of stroke-related impairment. Subjects post-stroke and age-matched controls underwent rs-fMRI. Stroke-related disability was correlated with lesion size CST-LL and interhemispheric S1 and M1 rs-FC as independent seeds. Regression analyses were performed to assess the contribution of these markers in stroke-related deficits. Post-stroke subjects showed an asymmetrical pattern of rs-FC in which affected hemisphere S1 and M1 were mostly connected with ipsi-lesional regions. Correlations between rs-FC and stroke-severity were found. Adding rs-FC of S1 to the regression model of impairment decreased the variance 31% compared to lesion size only. After a stroke S1 interhemispheric connectivity is decreased with S1 only connected with ipsi-lesional regions. This asymmetry correlates with neurological and motor impairment. Furthermore when combined with lesion anatomical measures S1 connectivity might be an important marker in explaining stroke outcome." Interhemispheric connectivity of primary sensory cortex is associated with motor impairment after stroke.
