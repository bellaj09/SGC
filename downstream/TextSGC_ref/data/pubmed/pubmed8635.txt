Measuring conditional relatedness the degree of relation between a pair of genes in a certain condition is a basic but difficult task in bioinformatics as traditional co-expression analysis methods rely on co-expression similarities well known with high false positive rate. Complement with prior-knowledge similarities is a feasible way to tackle the problem. However classical combination machine learning algorithms fail in detection and application of the complex mapping relations between similarities and conditional relatedness so a powerful predictive model will have enormous benefit for measuring this kind of complex mapping relations. To this need we propose a novel deep learning model of convolutional neural network with a fully connected first layer named fully convolutional neural network FCNN to measure conditional relatedness between genes using both co-expression and prior-knowledge similarities. The results on validation and test datasets show FCNN model yields an average 3.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy values for identifying gene-gene interactions collected from the COXPRESdb KEGG and TRRUST databases and a benchmark dataset of Xiao-Yong et al. research by grid-search 10-fold cross validation respectively. In order to estimate the FCNN model we conduct a further verification on the GeneFriends and DIP datasets and the FCNN model obtains an average of 1.8% and 7.6% higher accuracy respectively. Then the FCNN model is applied to construct cancer gene networks and also calls more practical results than other compared models and methods.
