Patients undergoing general anesthesia may awaken and become aware of the surgical procedure. Due to neuromuscular blocking agents patients could be conscious yet unable to move. Using brain-computer interface BCI technology it may be possible to detect movement attempts from the EEG. However it is unknown how an anesthetic influences the brain response to motor tasks. Decoding motor responses from the EEG during altered states of consciousness induced by propofol.
