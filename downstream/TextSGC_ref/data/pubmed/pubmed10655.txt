Recent clinical evidence has put forward a new region of interest for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Deep brain stimulation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis BST significantly attenuates symptoms in patients suffering from severe treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. The BST is not typically implicated in OCD neuropsychopathology but is certainly not an unknown in the field of emotional learning and memory. Substantial evidence supports its involvement in anxiety responses particularly to ambiguous threats. This seems consistent with the intolerance of uncertainty and tendency to overestimate danger which fuel obsessions and compulsions in many patients with OCD. Translational research in rodents can help to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of high-frequency electrical stimulation in the BST on anxiety which may be valuable to improve treatment for psychiatric patients.
