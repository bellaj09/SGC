Opiate addiction remains intractable in a large percentage of patients and relapse is the biggest hurdle to recovery. Many studies have identified a central role of the nucleus accumbens NAc in addiction. Deep brain stimulation DBS has the advantages of being reversible adjustable and minimally invasive and it has become a potential neurobiological intervention for addiction. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether high-frequency DBS in the NAc effectively attenuates the reinstatement of morphine seeking in morphine-primed rats. Inhibition of the reinstatement of morphine-induced place preference in rats by high-frequency stimulation of the bilateral nucleus accumbens.
