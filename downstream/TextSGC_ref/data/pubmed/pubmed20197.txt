"This work presents CloudMC a cloud computing application-developed in Windows Azure the platform of the Microsoft cloud-for the parallelization of Monte Carlo simulations in a dynamic virtual cluster. CloudMC is a web application designed to be independent of the Monte Carlo code in which the simulations are based-the simulations just need to be of the form: input files  executable  output files. To study the performance of CloudMC in Windows Azure Monte Carlo simulations with penelope were performed on different instance virtual machine sizes and for different number of instances. The instance size was found to have no effect on the simulation runtime. It was also found that the decrease in time with the number of instances followed Amdahls law with a slight deviation due to the increase in the fraction of non-parallelizable time with increasing number of instances. A simulation that would have required 30\xa0h of CPU on a single instance was completed in 48.6\xa0min when executed on 64 instances in parallel speedup of 37 . Furthermore the use of cloud computing for parallel computing offers some advantages over conventional clusters: high accessibility scalability and pay per usage. Therefore it is strongly believed that cloud computing will play an important role in making Monte Carlo dose calculation a reality in future clinical practice."
