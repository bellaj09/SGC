Potable electroencephalography EEG devices have become critical for important research. They have various applications such as in brain-computer interfaces BCI. Numerous recent investigations have focused on the development of dry sensors but few concern the simultaneous attachment of high-density dry sensors to different regions of the scalp to receive qualified EEG signals from hairy sites. An inflatable and wearable wireless 32-channel EEG device was designed prototyped and experimentally validated for making EEG signal measurements; it incorporates spring-loaded dry sensors and a novel gasbag design to solve the problem of interference by hair. The cap is ventilated and incorporates a circuit board and battery with a high-tolerance wireless Bluetooth protocol and low power consumption characteristics. The proposed system provides a 500/250 Hz sampling rate and 24 bit EEG data to meet the BCI system data requirement. Experimental results prove that the proposed EEG system is effective in measuring audio event-related potential measuring visual event-related potential and rapid serial visual presentation. Results of this work demonstrate that the proposed EEG cap system performs well in making EEG measurements and is feasible for practical applications.
