There is a growing concern that traditional neuropsychological NP testing tools are not sensitive to detecting residual brain dysfunctions in subjects suffering from mild traumatic brain injuries MTBI. Moreover most MTBI patients are asymptomatic based on anatomical brain imaging CT MRI neurological examinations and patients\ subjective reports within 10 days post-injury. Our ongoing research has documented that residual balance and visual-kinesthetic dysfunctions along with its underlying alterations of neural substrates may be detected in "asymptomatic subjects" by means of Virtual Reality VR graphics incorporated with brain imaging EEG techniques. Incorporating virtual reality graphics with brain imaging for assessment of sport-related concussions.
