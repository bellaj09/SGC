Brain-Computer Interface BCI is a rapidly developing technology that aims to support individuals suffering from various disabilities and ultimately improve everyday quality of life. Sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs have demonstrated remarkable results in controlling virtual or physical external devices but they still face a number of challenges and limitations. Main challenges include multiple degrees-of-freedom control accuracy and robustness. In this work we develop a multiclass BCI decoding algorithm that uses electroencephalography EEG source imaging a technique that maps scalp potentials to cortical activations to compensate for low spatial resolution of EEG. Spatial features were extracted using Common Spatial Pattern CSP filters in the cortical source space from a number of selected Regions of Interest ROIs. Classification was performed through an ensemble model based on individual ROI classification models. The evaluation was performed on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a which features 4 motor imagery classes from 9 participants. Our results revealed a mean accuracy increase of 5.6% with respect to the conventional application method of CSP on sensors. Neuroanatomical constraints and prior neurophysiological knowledge play an important role in developing source space-based BCI algorithms. Feature selection and classifier characteristics of our implementation will be explored to raise performance to current state-of-the-art.
