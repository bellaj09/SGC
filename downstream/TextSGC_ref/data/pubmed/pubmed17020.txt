Collaborative virtual environments CVEs which allow naturalistic communication between two or more individuals in a shared virtual environment hold promise as a tool for measuring and promoting social communication between peers. In this work a CVE platform and a set of CVE-based collaborative games are designed for children with autism spectrum disorder ASD. Two groups 7 ASD/TD pairs; 7 TD/TD pairs participated in a pilot study to establish system feasibility and tolerability. We also designed a methodology for capturing meaningful metrics of social communication. Based on these metrics we found improved game performance and trends in communication of these participants over time. Although preliminary these results provide important insights on CVE-based interaction for ASD intervention.
