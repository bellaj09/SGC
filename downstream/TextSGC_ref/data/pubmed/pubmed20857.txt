The safe performance of regional anaesthesia RA requires theoretical knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality VR-based simulators may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different techniques. However currently available VR simulators do not consider individual anatomy which limits their use for realistic training. We have developed a VR-based simulator that can be used for individual anatomy and for different anatomical regions. Virtual reality-based simulator for training in regional anaesthesia.
