Recent research suggests the brain can learn almost any brain-computer interface BCI configuration; however contrasting behavioral evidence from structural learning theory argues that previous experience facilitates or impedes future learning. A study by Sadtler and colleagues Nature 512: 423-426 2014 used BCI to demonstrate that neural network structural characteristics constrain learning a finding that might also provide insight into how the brain responds to and recovers after injury. Structural constraints on learning in the neural network.
