In the field of computational structural proteomics contact predictions have shown new prospects of solving the longstanding problem of ab initio protein structure prediction. In the last few years application of deep learning algorithms and availability of large protein sequence databases combined with improvement in methods that derive contacts from multiple sequence alignments have shown a huge increase in the precision of contact prediction. In addition these predicted contacts have also been used to build three-dimensional models from scratch.In this chapter we briefly discuss many elements of protein residue-residue contacts and the methods available for prediction focusing on a state-of-the-art contact prediction tool DNcon. Illustrating with a case study we describe how DNcon can be used to make ab initio contact predictions for a given protein sequence and discuss how the predicted contacts may be analyzed and evaluated.
