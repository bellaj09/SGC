Cerebral vessel segmentation is essential and helpful for the clinical diagnosis and the related research. However automatic segmentation of brain vessels remains challenging because of the variable vessel shape and high complex of vessel geometry. This study proposes a new active contour model ACM implemented by the level-set method for segmenting vessels from TOF-MRA data. The energy function of the new model combining both region intensity and boundary information is composed of two region terms one boundary term and one penalty term. The global threshold representing the lower gray boundary of the target object by maximum intensity projection MIP is defined in the first-region term and it is used to guide the segmentation of the thick vessels. In the second term a dynamic intensity threshold is employed to extract the tiny vessels. The boundary term is used to drive the contours to evolve towards the boundaries with high gradients. The penalty term is used to avoid reinitialization of the level-set function. Experimental results on 10 clinical brain data sets demonstrate that our method is not only able to achieve better Dice Similarity Coefficient than the global threshold based method and localized hybrid level-set method but also able to extract whole cerebral vessel trees including the thin vessels.
