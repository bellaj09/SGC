A local field potential LFP signal is an alternative source to neural action potentials for decoding kinematic and kinetic information from the brain. Here we demonstrate that the better extraction of force-related features from multichannel LFPs improves the accuracy of force decoding. We propose that applying canonical correlation analysis CCA filter on the envelopes of separate frequency bands band-specific CCA separates non-task related information from the LFPs. The decoding accuracy of the continuous force signal based on the proposed method were compared with three feature reduction methods: 1 band-specific principal component analysis band-specific PCA method that extract the components which leads to maximum variance from the envelopes of different frequency bands; 2 correlation coefficient-based CC-based feature reduction that selects the best features from the envelopes sorted based on the absolute correlation coefficient between each envelope and the target force signal; and 3 mutual information-based MI-based feature reduction that selects the best features from the envelopes sorted based on the mutual information between each envelope and output force signal. The band-specific CCA method outperformed band-specific PCA with 11% improvement CC-based feature reduction with 16% improvement and MI-based feature reduction with 18% improvement. In the online brain control experiments the real-time decoded force signal from the 16-channel LFPs based on the proposed method was used to move a mechanical arm. Two rats performed 88 trials in seven sessions to control the mechanical arm based on the 16-channel LFPs.
