Because of their outstanding electrical and mechanical properties graphene strain sensors have attracted extensive attention for electronic applications in virtual reality robotics medical diagnostics and healthcare. Although several strain sensors based on graphene have been reported the stretchability and sensitivity of these sensors remain limited and also there is a pressing need to develop a practical fabrication process. This paper reports the fabrication and characterization of new types of graphene strain sensors based on stretchable yarns. Highly stretchable sensitive and wearable sensors are realized by a layer-by-layer assembly method that is simple low-cost scalable and solution-processable. Because of the yarn structures these sensors exhibit high stretchability up to 150% and versatility and can detect both large- and small-scale human motions. For this study wearable electronics are fabricated with implanted sensors that can monitor diverse human motions including joint movement phonation swallowing and breathing. Highly stretchable and wearable graphene strain sensors with controllable sensitivity for human motion monitoring.
