One of the most reported neural features of autism spectrum disorder ASD is the alteration of multiple long-range white matter fiber tracts as assessed by diffusion-weighted imaging and indexed by reduced fractional anisotropy FA. Recent methodological advances however have shown that this same pattern of reduced FA may be an artifact resulting from excessive head motion and poorer data quality and that aberrant structural connectivity in children with ASD is confined to the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus ILF. This study aimed at replicating the observation of reduced FA along the right ILF in ASD while controlling for group differences in head motion and data quality. In addition we explored associations between reduced FA in the right ILF and quantitative ASD characteristics and the involvement of the right ILF in visual processing which is known to be altered in ASD.
