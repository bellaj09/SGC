Neural circuits typically consist of many different types of neurons and one faces a challenge in disentangling their individual contributions in measured neural activity. Classification of cells into inhibitory and excitatory neurons and localization of neurons on the basis of extracellular recordings are frequently employed procedures. Current approaches however need a lot of human intervention which makes them slow biased and unreliable. In light of recent advances in deep learning techniques and exploiting the availability of neuron models with quasi-realistic three-dimensional morphology and physiological properties we present a framework for automatized and objective classification and localization of cells based on the spatiotemporal profiles of the extracellular action potentials recorded by multielectrode arrays. We train convolutional neural networks on simulated signals from a large set of cell models and show that our framework can predict the position of neurons with high accuracy more precisely than current state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also able to classify whether a neuron is excitatory or inhibitory with very high accuracy substantially improving on commonly used clustering techniques. Furthermore our new method seems to have the potential to separate certain subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The possibility of automatically localizing and classifying all neurons recorded with large high-density extracellular electrodes contributes to a more accurate and more reliable mapping of neural circuits. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We propose a novel approach to localize and classify neurons from their extracellularly recorded action potentials with a combination of biophysically detailed neuron models and deep learning techniques. Applied to simulated data this new combination of forward modeling and machine learning yields higher performance compared with state-of-the-art localization and classification methods.
