To study the physiologic mechanism of the brain during different motor imagery MI tasks the authors employed a method of brain-network modeling based on time-frequency cross mutual information obtained from 4-class left hand right hand feet and tongue MI tasks recorded as brain-computer interface BCI electroencephalography data. The authors explored the brain network revealed by these MI tasks using statistical analysis and the analysis of topologic characteristics and observed significant differences in the reaction level reaction time and activated target during 4-class MI tasks. There was a great difference in the reaction level between the execution and resting states during different tasks: the reaction level of the left-hand MI task was the greatest followed by that of the right-hand feet and tongue MI tasks. The reaction time required to perform the tasks also differed: during the left-hand and right-hand MI tasks the brain networks of subjects reacted promptly and strongly but there was a delay during the feet and tongue MI task. Statistical analysis and the analysis of network topology revealed the target regions of the brain network during different MI processes. In conclusion our findings suggest a new way to explain the neural mechanism behind MI.
