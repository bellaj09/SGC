"An increasing number of neuroscience experiments are using virtual reality to provide a more immersive and less artificial experimental environment. This is particularly useful to navigation and three-dimensional scene perception experiments. Such experiments require accurate real-time tracking of the observers head in order to render the virtual scene. Here we present data on the accuracy of a commonly used six degrees of freedom tracker Intersense IS900 when it is moved in ways typical of virtual reality applications. We compared the reported location of the tracker with its location computed by an optical tracking method. When the tracker was stationary the root mean square error in spatial accuracy was 0.64 mm. However we found that errors increased over ten-fold up to 17 mm when the tracker moved at speeds common in virtual reality applications. We demonstrate that the errors we report here are predominantly due to inaccuracies of the IS900 system rather than the optical tracking against which it was compared."
