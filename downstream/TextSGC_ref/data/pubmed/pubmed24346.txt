Substantial evidence in the scientific literature supports the use of simulation for surgical education. However curricula lack for complex laparoscopic procedures in gynecology. The objective was to evaluate the validity of a program that reproduces key specific components of a laparoscopic hysterectomy LH procedure until colpotomy on a virtual reality VR simulator and to develop an evidence-based and stepwise training curriculum. Development of an evidence-based training program for laparoscopic hysterectomy on a virtual reality simulator.
