In autism spectrum disorder lack of coherence and of complex information processing and narrowly focused interests and repetitive behaviors are considered a sign of long-range underconnectivity and short-range overconnectivity. The goal of this morphometric study of five anatomically and functionally different segments of the corpus callosum CC was to establish patterns of differences between long-range interhemispheric connections in nine neurotypical and nine autistic subjects. Deficit of corpus callosum axons reduced axon diameter and decreased area are markers of abnormal development of interhemispheric connections in autistic subjects.
