How are abstract signals like intent represented in neural populations? By creating a direct link between neural activity and behavior brain-computer interfaces BCIs can help answer this question. Early instantiations of these devices sought mainly to mimic arm movements: by building models of arm tuning for the neurons desired arm movements could be read out and used to control various prosthetic devices. However as the functionality of these devices increases a more general approach that relies less on endogenous control signals may be required. Here we review some of the current model-based approaches for finding volitional control signals for spiking-based BCIs and present some new approaches for finding control signals without resorting to parametric models of neural activity. Inference from populations: going beyond models.
