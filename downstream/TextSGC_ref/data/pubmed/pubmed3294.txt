The dysconnectivity hypothesis suggests that psychotic illnesses arise not from regionally specific focal pathophysiology but rather from impaired neuroanatomical integration across networks of brain regions. Decreased white matter organization has been hypothesized to be a feature of psychotic illnesses in general which is supported by meta-analyses of DTI studies in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Although many diffusion MRI studies investigate bipolar disorder and schizophrenia alone relatively few studies directly compare structural features in these psychotic illnesses. Recently the application of graph theory analyses to DTI data has supported the dysconnectivity hypothesis in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia employing topological properties to assess neuroanatomical dysconnectivity.
