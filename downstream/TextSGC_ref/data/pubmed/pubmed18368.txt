We coined a new word "dromosagnosia" from the Greek words dromos "way road"+agnosia to describe the loss of direction while driving an orientation disorder similar to but different from pure topographic disorientation. Historically human beings have moved more quickly from using domesticated animals to high speed vehicles and this may be beyond the brain\s ability to react. Without the benefit of an automatic navigation system automobiles are associated with more problems of dromosagnosia than are fast-moving aircraft or ships. Previous studies have noted that some areas of the brain are associated with spatial orientation spatial memory and even emotion and abnormalities there could exacerbate the loss of sense of direction. We hypothesize that some people are especially disadvantaged from these brain differences and emotional disturbances when driving their cars. Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and event-related potentials ERP studies combined with a virtual reality driving simulation might be used to find the areas of the brain related to dromosagnosia. Future applications: some people with dromosagnosia might benefit from special remedial training and a driving safety support system to avoid potential problems. Dromosagnosia or why some people lose their sense of direction while driving.
