This paper presents a novel feature extraction approach for motor imagery classification overcoming the weakness of conventional common spatial pattern CSP methods especially for small sample settings. We consider local CSPs generated from individual channels and their neighbors termed "local regions" rather than a global CSP generated from all channels. The novelty is to select a few good local regions using interquartile range IQR or an "above the mean" rule based on variance ratio dispersion score VRDS and inter-class feature distance ICFD; instead of computationally expensive cross-validation method. Furthermore we develop frequency optimization using filter banks by extending the VRDS and ICFD to frequency-optimized local CSPs. The proposed methods are tested on three publicly available brain-computer interface BCI datasets: BCI competition III dataset IVa BCI competition IV dataset I and BCI competition IV dataset IIb. The proposed method exhibits substantially improved classification accuracy compared to recent related motor imagery MI classification methods.
