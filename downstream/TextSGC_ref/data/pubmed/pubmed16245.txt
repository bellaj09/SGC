"We present the development of a flight simulator that allows the user to interact in a created environment by means of virtual reality devices. This environment simulates the sight of a pilot in an airplane cockpit. The environment is projected in a helmet visor and allows the pilot to see inside as well as outside the cockpit. The movement of the airplane is independent of the movement of the pilots head which means that the airplane might travel in one direction while the pilot is looking at a 30 degrees angle with respect to the traveled direction. In this environment the pilot will be able to take off fly and land the airplane. So far the objects in the environment are geometrical figures. This is an ongoing project and only partial results are available now." Development of a virtual flight simulator.
