This paper presents a novel and computationally simple tri-training based semi-supervised steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI. It is implemented with autocorrelation-based features and a Nave-Bayes classifier NBC. The system uses nine characters presented on a 100 Hz CRT-monitor three scalp electrodes for signal acquisition a gUSB-amp for preamplification and two PCs for data-processing and stimulus control respectively. Preliminary test results of the system on nine healthy subjects with and without tri-training indicates that the accuracy improves as a result of tri-training. Semi-supervised adaptation in ssvep-based brain-computer interface using tri-training.
