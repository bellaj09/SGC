"Diffusion imaging has been instrumental in understanding damage to the central nervous system as a result of its sensitivity to microstructural changes. Clinical applications of diffusion imaging have grown exponentially over the past couple of decades in many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis MS. For several reasons MS has been extensively researched using advanced neuroimaging techniques which makes it an example disease to illustrate the potential of diffusion imaging for clinical applications. In addition MS pathology is characterized by several key processes competing with each other such as inflammation demyelination remyelination gliosis and axonal loss enabling the specificity of diffusion to be challenged. In this review we describe how diffusion imaging can be exploited to investigate micro- meso- and macro-scale properties of the brain structure and discuss how they are affected by different pathological substrates. Conclusions from the literature are that larger studies are needed to confirm the exciting results from initial investigations before current trends in diffusion imaging can be translated to the neurology clinic. Also for a comprehensive understanding of pathological processes it is essential to take a multiple-level approach in which information at the micro- meso- and macroscopic scales is fully integrated."
