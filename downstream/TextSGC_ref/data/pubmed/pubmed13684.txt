Advances in the quality of whole-slide images have set the stage for the clinical use of digital images in anatomic pathology. Along with advances in computer image analysis this raises the possibility for computer-assisted diagnostics in pathology to improve histopathologic interpretation and clinical care. To evaluate the potential impact of digital assistance on interpretation of digitized slides we conducted a multireader multicase study utilizing our deep learning algorithm for the detection of breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes. Six pathologists reviewed 70 digitized slides from lymph node sections in 2 reader modes unassisted and assisted with a wash-out period between sessions. In the assisted mode the deep learning algorithm was used to identify and outline regions with high likelihood of containing tumor. Algorithm-assisted pathologists demonstrated higher accuracy than either the algorithm or the pathologist alone. In particular algorithm assistance significantly increased the sensitivity of detection for micrometastases 91% vs. 83% P=0.02. In addition average review time per image was significantly shorter with assistance than without assistance for both micrometastases 61 vs. 116\u2009s P=0.002 and negative images 111 vs. 137\u2009s P=0.018. Lastly pathologists were asked to provide a numeric score regarding the difficulty of each image classification. On the basis of this score pathologists considered the image review of micrometastases to be significantly easier when interpreted with assistance P=0.0005. Utilizing a proof of concept assistant tool this study demonstrates the potential of a deep learning algorithm to improve pathologist accuracy and efficiency in a digital pathology workflow.
