In recent years improved wireless technologies computing power and analytics are leading to rapid growth in the AR industry. Novel health care-specific use cases are rapidly being introduced with the potential to widely affect clinical care particularly in dermatology because of the visual nature of the field. In this article we define AR profile clinical and educational uses of AR in dermatology and discuss key policy considerations for the safe and appropriate use of this emerging technology. Augmented reality in dermatology: Are we ready for AR?
