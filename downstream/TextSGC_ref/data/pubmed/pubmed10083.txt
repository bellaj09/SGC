MicroRNAs miRNAs are well-studied small noncoding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation in a wide range of organisms including mammals. Their function is mediated by base pairing with their target RNAs. Although many features required for miRNA-mediated repression have been described the identification of functional interactions is still challenging. In the last two decades numerous Machine Learning ML models have been developed to predict their putative targets. In this review we summarize the biological knowledge and the experimental data used to develop these ML models. Recently Deep Neural Network-based models have also emerged in miRNA interaction modeling. We thus outline established and emerging models to give a perspective on the future developments needed to improve the identification of genes directly regulated by miRNAs.
