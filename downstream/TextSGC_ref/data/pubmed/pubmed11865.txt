Semi-supervised learning is known to achieve better generalisation than a model learned solely from labelled data. Therefore we propose a new method for estimating a pedestrian pose orientation using a soft-target method which is a type of semi-supervised learning method. Because a convolutional neural network CNN based pose orientation estimation requires large numbers of parameters and operations we apply the teacherstudent algorithm to generate a compressed student model with high accuracy and compactness resembling that of the teacher model by combining a deep network with a random forest. After the teacher model is generated using hard target data the softened outputs soft-target data of the teacher model are used for training the student model. Moreover the orientation of the pedestrian has specific shape patterns and a wavelet transform is applied to the input image as a pre-processing step owing to its good spatial frequency localisation property and the ability to preserve both the spatial information and gradient information of an image. For a benchmark dataset considering real driving situations based on a single camera we used the TUD and KITTI datasets. We applied the proposed algorithm to various driving images in the datasets and the results indicate that its classification performance with regard to the pose orientation is better than that of other state-of-the-art methods based on a CNN. In addition the computational speed of the proposed student model is faster than that of other deep CNNs owing to the shorter model structure with a smaller number of parameters.
