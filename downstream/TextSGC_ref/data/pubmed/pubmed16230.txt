Autism Spectrum Disorders ASDs are developmental disorders affecting communication and behavior. ASD incidence in the world population is about 1% with a 4:1 ratio between males and females. In clinical practice ASDs have been usually treated with cognitive-behavioral approaches involving a face-to-face interaction with the therapist. Over the last years virtual reality VR has played an important role in neurorehabilitation even for ASD cognitive treatment. A 16-year-old boy with severe ASD and his caregiver were enrolled in the study. Two different cognitive trainings were administered; first the boy was submitted to one-month cognitive behavioral therapy CBT; then after one month of rest a combined approach using VR by means of the BTS-Nirvana System and CBT was applied. Only the combined approach provided an improvement in attention processes and spatial cognition skills with a significant reduction of ideomotor stereotypes. According to this experience the use of VR in addition to CBT could be a useful and promising tool to improve cognitive function in individuals severely affected by ASD.
