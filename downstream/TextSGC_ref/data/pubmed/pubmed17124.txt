The purpose of this study was to evaluate preservation of cognitive function after deep brain stimulation DBS of the subgenual cingulate Cg25 for treatment-resistant depression TRD. We have previously reported on the treatment methods safety and 6-month clinical outcome Mayberg et al. Neuron. 2005;45:651-660. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments tapping 4 domains of frontal lobe function and general cognitive abilities were completed before implantation and at 3 6 and 12 months postonset of continuous DBS in 6 TRD patients. No adverse neuropsychological effects were noted following surgery onset and maintenance of DBS with the exception of transient motor slowing noted at 3 and 6 months that improved to normative levels by 12 months. Several areas of cognition that were below average or impaired at baseline improved over follow-up and these changes were not correlated with improvements in mood. Though the sample size is small these results support cognitive safety of Cg25 DBS for TRD.
