Chest x-ray CXR analysis is a common part of the protocol for confirming active pulmonary Tuberculosis TB. However many TB endemic regions are severely resource constrained in radiological services impairing timely detection and treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis CADx tools can supplement decision-making while simultaneously addressing the gap in expert radiological interpretation during mobile field screening. These tools use hand-engineered and/or convolutional neural networks CNN computed image features. CNN a class of deep learning DL models has gained research prominence in visual recognition. It has been shown that Ensemble learning has an inherent advantage of constructing non-linear decision making functions and improve visual recognition. We create a stacking of classifiers with hand-engineered and CNN features toward improving TB detection in CXRs. The results obtained are highly promising and superior to the state-of-the-art. A novel stacked generalization of models for improved TB detection in chest radiographs.
