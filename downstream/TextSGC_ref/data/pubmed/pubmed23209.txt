"Crossing a street can be a very difficult task for older pedestrians. With increased age and potential cognitive decline older people take the decision to cross a street primarily based on vehicles distance and not on their speed. Furthermore older pedestrians tend to overestimate their own walking speed and could not adapt it according to the traffic conditions. Pedestrians behavior is often tested using virtual reality. Virtual reality presents the advantage of being safe cost-effective and allows using standardized test conditions." Street crossing behavior in younger and older pedestrians: an eye- and head-tracking study.
