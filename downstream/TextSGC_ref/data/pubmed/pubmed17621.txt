Binaural rendering of Ambisonic signals is of great interest in the fields of virtual reality immersive media and virtual acoustics. Typically the spatial order of head-related impulse responses HRIRs is considerably higher than the order of the Ambisonic signals. The resulting order reduction of the HRIRs has a detrimental effect on the binaurally rendered signals and perceptual evaluations indicate limited externalization localization accuracy and altered timbre. In this contribution a binaural renderer which is computed using a frequency-dependent time alignment of HRIRs followed by a minimization of the squared error subject to a diffuse-field covariance matrix constraint is presented. The frequency-dependent time alignment retains the interaural time difference at low frequencies and results in a HRIR set with lower spatial complexity while the constrained optimization controls the diffuse-field behavior. Technical evaluations in terms of sound coloration interaural level differences diffuse-field response and interaural coherence as well as findings from formal listening experiments show a significant improvement of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.
