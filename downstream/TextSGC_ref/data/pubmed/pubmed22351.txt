"Studying the three-dimensional 3D anatomy of the cavernous sinus is essential for treating lesions in this region with skull base surgeries. Cadaver dissection is a conventional method that has insurmountable flaws with regard to understanding spatial anatomy. The authors research aimed to build an image model of the cavernous sinus region in a virtual reality system to precisely individually and objectively elucidate the complete and local stereo-anatomy." Virtual Reality Model of the Three-Dimensional Anatomy of the Cavernous Sinus Based on a Cadaveric Image and Dissection.
