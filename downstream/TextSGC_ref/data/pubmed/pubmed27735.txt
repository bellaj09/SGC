Performing foot motor imagery is accompanied by a peri-imagery ERD and a post-imagery beta ERS beta rebound. Our aim was to study whether the post-imagery beta rebound is a suitable feature for a simple "brain switch". Such a brain switch is a specifically designed brain-computer interface BCI with the aim to detect only one predefined brain state e.g. EEG pattern in ongoing brain activity. Could the beta rebound in the EEG be suitable to realize a "brain switch"?
