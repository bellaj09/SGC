The amount of coronary artery calcium determined in CT scans is a well established predictor of cardiovascular events. However high interscan variability of coronary calcium quantification may lead to incorrect cardiovascular risk assignment. Partial volume effect contributes to high interscan variability. Hence we propose a method for coronary calcium quantification employing partial volume correction. Coronary calcium scoring with partial volume correction in anthropomorphic thorax phantom and screening chest CT images.
