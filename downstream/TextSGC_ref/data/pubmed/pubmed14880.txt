"Genetic models of Parkinsons disease PD coupled with advanced imaging techniques can elucidate neurobiological disease progression and can help identify early biomarkers before clinical signs emerge. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 PINK1 helps protect neurons from mitochondrial dysfunction and a mutation in the associated gene is a risk factor for recessive familial PD. The PINK1 knockout KO rat is a novel model for familial PD that has not been neuroradiologically characterized for alterations in brain structure/function alongside behavior prior to 4 months of age." Evidence of Neurobiological Changes in the Presymptomatic PINK1 Knockout Rat.
