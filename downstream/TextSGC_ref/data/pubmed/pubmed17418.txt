Recent advances in computed tomography angiography CTA enable repeated imaging follow up for post-clipping surgery. The purpose of this study was to clarify the critical volume and configuration of the aneurysmal clip in the postoperative evaluation using volume rendering VR imaging and present four-dimensional 4D-CTA for these larger metal artifacts. A total of 44 patients with cerebral aneurysm treated using clipping surgery were included in this study. The metal artifact volume was assessed using CTA and the association between the type of clips and its metal artifact volume was analyzed. A VR image and a 4D-CTA were then produced and the diagnostic accuracy of arteries around the clip or residual aneurysm on these images was evaluated. In the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve analysis the cutoff value for metal artifacts was 2.32\xa0mm3 as determined through a VR image. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 included patients with a simple and small clip and group 2 included patients with multiple large or fenestrated clips. The metal artifact volume was significantly larger in group 2 and the group incorporated the cutoff value. Post-clipping status on the VR image was significantly superior in group 1 compared with group 2. In group 2 the imaging quality of post-clipping status on 4D-CTA was superior in 92.9% of patients. The metal artifact volume was dependent on the number size or configuration of the clip used. In group 2 evaluation using a 4D-CTA eliminated the effect of the metal artifacts.
