A recurrent criticism concerning the use of online social media data in political science research is the lack of demographic information about social media users. By employing a face-recognition algorithm to the profile pictures of Facebook users the paper derives two fundamental demographic characteristics age and gender of a sample of Facebook users who interacted with the most relevant British parties in the two weeks before the Brexit referendum of 23 June 2016. The article achieves the goals of i testing the precision of the algorithm ii testing its validity iii inferring new evidence on digital mobilisation and iv tracing the path for future developments and application of the algorithm. The findings show that the algorithm is reliable and that it can be fruitfully used in political and social sciences both to confirm the validity of survey data and to obtain information from populations that are generally unavailable within traditional surveys. Using deep-learning algorithms to derive basic characteristics of social media users: The Brexit campaign as a case study.
