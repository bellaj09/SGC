Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia VF/VT known as shockable SH rhythms are the mainly cause of sudden cardiac arrests SCA which is cured efficiently by the automated external defibrillator AED. The performance of the shock advice algorithm SAA applied in the AED has been improved by using machine learning technique and variously conventional features recently. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm with relatively high performance for the SCA detection on electrocardiogram ECG signal. The algorithm consists of a convolutional neural network as a feature extractor CNNE and a Boosting BS classifier. A grid search with nested 5-folds cross validation CV is used to select the CNNE trained with preprocessed ECG SH and NSH signals using the modified variational mode decomposition technique. The deep feature vector learned by this CNNE is extracted at the first fully connected layer and then fed into BS classifier to validate its performance using 5-folds CV procedure. The secondary learning of the BS classifier and the use of three input channels for the CNNE improve certainly the detection performance of the proposed SAA with the validated accuracy of 99.26% sensitivity of 97.07% and specificity of 99.44%.
