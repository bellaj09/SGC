White matter WM alteration is considered to be a vital neurological mechanism of obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. However little is known regarding the changes in topological organization of WM structural network in OCD. We acquired diffusion tensor imaging DTI datasets from 28 drug-nave OCD patients and 28 well-matched healthy controls HC. A deterministic fiber tracking approach was used to construct the whole-brain structural connectome. Group differences in global and nodal topological properties as well as rich-club organizations were compared by using graph theory analysis. The relationship between the altered network metrics and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Y-BOCS was calculated. Compared with controls OCD patients exhibited a significantly decreased small-worldness  normalized clustering coefficient  and shortest path length Lp as well as an increased global efficiency Eglob. The nodal efficiency Enodal was found to be reduced in the left middle frontal gyrus and increased in the right parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral putamen in OCD patients. Besides OCD patients showed increased rich-club feeder and local connection strength and the connection strength of the rich-club was positively correlated with the total Y-BOCS score. Our findings emphasized a central role for the complicatedly changed topological architecture of brain structural networks in the pathological mechanism underlying OCD.
