The authors have presented several 3-D CT imaging techniques that may be useful in dentistry. MPR and dental MPR provides cross-sectional images of the jaws and the dental arches and its utility in implant treatment planning is widely recognized. SSD allows the clinician to visualize the surface of an anatomic structure that is selected by a threshold value. Volume rendering is a powerful and flexible three-dimensional imaging technique that can create various unique images. MIP may be useful in contrast-enhanced CT examinations such as sialography. Model production and virtual reality three-dimensional imaging may become major techniques in the near future. Although the increased radiation dose to the patients has to be considered future imaging demands will bring more access to 3-D CT imaging by dental patients and with adequate three-dimensional rendering techniques more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
