Three-dimensional reconstruction of optical coherence tomography OCT images is a modern technique that helps interpret the images and understand the underlying disease. However the 3D reconstruction displayed on commercial devices is of limited quality: images are shown on 2D screens and it is difficult or impossible to adjust the view point and capture the data set from a meaningful perspective. We did a preliminary study to evaluate the applicability of a novel 3D TV-based virtual reality system with interactive volume rendering software to clinical diagnostics and present a workflow which can incorporate virtual reality technology at various levels of immersion into the daily medical practice from interactive VR systems to printed media. Visualization of three-dimensional ultra-high resolution OCT in virtual reality.
