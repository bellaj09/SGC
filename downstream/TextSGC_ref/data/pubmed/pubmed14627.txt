Manually reviewing electroencephalograms EEGs is labor-intensive and demands automated seizure detection systems. To construct an efficient and robust event detector for experimental seizures from continuous EEG monitoring we combined spectral analysis and deep neural networks. A deep neural network was trained to discriminate periodograms of 5-sec EEG segments from annotated convulsive seizures and the pre- and post-EEG segments. To use the entire EEG for training a second network was trained with non-seizure EEGs that were misclassified as seizures by the first network. By sequentially applying the dual deep neural networks and simple pre- and post-processing our autodetector identified all seizure events in 4272 h of test EEG traces with only 6 false positive events corresponding to 100% sensitivity and 98% positive predictive value. Moreover with pre-processing to reduce the computational burden scanning and classifying 8977 h of training and test EEG datasets took only 2.28 h with a personal computer. These results demonstrate that combining a basic feature extractor with dual deep neural networks and rule-based pre- and post-processing can detect convulsive seizures with great accuracy and low computational burden highlighting the feasibility of our automated seizure detection algorithm.
