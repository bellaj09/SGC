Virtual reality therapy VRT has clinical indications in rehabilitation programs for the elderly; however there is still no consensus on the recovery of body balance. The objective of this review was to summarize the effects of physical therapy interventions with VRT in the rehabilitation of balance in the elderly. The studies were identified via a systematic search in the databases PubMed SciELO LILACS and PEDro from 2010 onward. Clinical trials with interventions that involved VRT in the elderly were included in the study and were subjected to methodological quality analysis using the PEDro scale. A random effects meta-analysis of the studies that analyzed balance using the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go TUG test was performed. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria which presented variability in relation to the types of interventions used 70% and the outcomes analyzed 60%. The mean duration of the interventions was 13.90  5.08 weeks with at least two weekly sessions  0.73. There were positive results in relation to improvements in both dynamic and static balance 70% of the studies mobility 80% flexibility 30% gait 20% and fall prevention 20%. A summary of the meta-analysis showed mean effects on the Berg scale standardized mean difference SMD: -0.848; 95% CI: -1.161; -\u20090.535 and the TUG test SMD: 0.894; 95% CI: 0.341; 1.447. Individually virtual reality is promising in rehabilitation programs for the elderly. The overall measures were sufficient to show beneficial effects of the therapy on balance in the elderly.
