In this paper we present Virtual Touch a toolkit that allows the development of educational activities through a mixed reality environment such that using various tangible elements the interconnection of a virtual world with the real world is enabled. The main goal of Virtual Touch is to facilitate the installation configuration and programming of different types of technologies abstracting the creator of educational applications from the technical details involving the use of tangible interfaces and virtual worlds. Therefore it is specially designed to enable teachers to themselves create educational activities for their students in a simple way taking into account that teachers generally lack advanced knowledge in computer programming and electronics. The toolkit has been used to develop various educational applications that have been tested in two secondary education high schools in Spain.
