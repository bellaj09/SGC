Operative neuromodulation is the field of altering electrically or chemically the signal transmission in the nervous system by implanted devices in order to excite inhibit or tune the activities of neurons or neural networks and produce therapeutic effects. It is a rapidly evolving biomedical and high-technology field on the cutting-edge of developments across a wide range of scientific disciplines. The authors review relevant literature on the neuromodulation procedures that are performed in the spinal cord or peripheral nerves in order to treat a considerable number of conditions such as a chronic pain craniofacial somatic pelvic limb or due to failed back surgery b spasticity due to spinal trauma multiple sclerosis upper motor neuron disease dystonia cerebral palsy cerebrovascular disease or head trauma c respiratory disorders d cardiovascular ischemia e neuropathic bladder and f bowel dysfunction of neural cause. Functional neuroprosthetics a field of operative neuromodulation encompasses the design construction and implantation of artificial devices capable of generating electrical stimuli thereby replacing the function of damaged parts of the nervous system. The present article also reviews important literature on functional neuroprostheses functional electrical stimulation FES and various emerging applications based on microsystems devices neural engineering neuroaugmentation neurostimulation and assistive technologies. The authors highlight promising lines of research such as endoneural prostheses for peripheral nerve stimulation closed-loop systems for responsive neurostimulation or implanted microwires for microstimulation of the spinal cord to enable movements of paralyzed limbs. The above growing scientific fields in combination with biological regenerative methods are certainly going to enhance the practice of neuromodulation. The range of neuromodulatory procedures in the spine and peripheral nerves and the dynamics of the biomedical and technological domains which are reviewed in this article indicate that new breakthroughs are likely to improve substantially the quality of life of patients who are severely disabled by neurological disorders. An introduction to operative neuromodulation and functional neuroprosthetics the new frontiers of clinical neuroscience and biotechnology.
