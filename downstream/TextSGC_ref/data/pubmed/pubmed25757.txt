Virtual Reality Modelling Language VRML is the start of a new era for medicine and the World Wide Web WWW. Scientists can use VRML across the Internet to explore new three-dimensional 3D worlds share concepts and collaborate together in a virtual environment. VRML enables the generation of virtual environments through the use of geometric spatial and colour data structures to represent 3D objects and scenes. In medicine researchers often want to interact with scientific data which in several instances may also be dynamic e.g. MRI data. This data is often very large and is difficult to visualise. A 3D graphical representation can make the information contained in such large data sets more understandable and easier to interpret. Fast networks and satellites can reliably transfer large data sets from computer to computer. This has led to the adoption of remote tale-working in many applications including medical applications. Radiology experts for example can view and inspect in near real-time a 3D data set acquired from a patient who is in another part of the world. Such technology is destined to improve the quality of life for many people. This paper introduces VRML including some technical details and discusses the advantages of VRML in application developing. WWW creates new interactive 3D graphics and collaborative environments for medical research and education.
