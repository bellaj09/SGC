Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry DIA-MS is a powerful technique that enables relatively deep proteomic profiling with superior quantification reproducibility. DIA data mining predominantly relies on a spectral library of sufficient proteome coverage that in most cases is built on data-dependent acquisition-based analysis of the same sample. To expand the proteome coverage for a pre-determined protein family we report herein on the construction of a hybrid spectral library that supplements a DIA experiment-derived library with a protein family-targeted virtual library predicted by deep learning. Leveraging this DIA hybrid library substantially deepens the coverage of three transmembrane protein families G protein-coupled receptors ion channels and transporters in mouse brain tissues with increases in protein identification of 37%-87% and peptide identification of 58%-161%. Moreover of the 412 novel GPCR peptides exclusively identified with the DIA hybrid library strategy 53.6% were validated as present in mouse brain tissues based on orthogonal experimental measurement. Hybrid Spectral Library Combining DIA-MS Data and a Targeted Virtual Library Substantially Deepens the Proteome Coverage.
