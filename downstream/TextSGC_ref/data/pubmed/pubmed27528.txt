Steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs have been widely employed for the control of brain-computer interfaces BCIs because they are very robust lead to high performance and allow for a high number of commands. However such flickering stimuli often also cause user discomfort and fatigue especially when several light sources are used simultaneously. Different variations of SSVEP driving signals have been proposed to increase user comfort. Here we investigate the suitability of frequency modulation of a high frequency carrier for SSVEP-BCIs. We compared BCI performance and user experience between frequency modulated FM and traditional sinusoidal SIN SSVEPs in an offline classification paradigm with four independently flickering light-emitting diodes which were overtly attended fixated. While classification performance was slightly reduced with the FM stimuli the user comfort was significantly increased. Comparing the SSVEPs for covert attention to the stimuli without fixation was not possible as no reliable SSVEPs were evoked. Our results reveal that several simultaneously flickering light emitting diodes can be used to generate FM-SSVEPs with different frequencies and the resulting occipital electroencephalography EEG signals can be classified with high accuracy. While the performance we report could be further improved with adjusted stimuli and algorithms we argue that the increased comfort is an important result and suggest the use of FM stimuli for future SSVEP-BCI applications.
