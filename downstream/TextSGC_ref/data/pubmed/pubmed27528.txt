"Abundant literature suggests the use of slow cortical potentials SCPs in a wide spectrum of basic and applied neuroscience areas. Due to their low signal to noise ratio these potentials are often studied using grand-average analysis which conceals trial-to-trial information. Moreover most of the single trial analysis methods in the literature are based on classical electroencephalogram EEG features 1-30 Hz and are likely to be unsuitable for SCPs that have different signal properties such as having the signals spectral content in the range 0.2-0.7 Hz. In this paper we provide insights into the selection of appropriate parameters for spectral and spatial filtering."
