A Brain-Computer Interface BCI is a setup permitting the control of external devices by decoding brain activity. Electroencephalography EEG has been extensively used for decoding brain activity since it is non-invasive cheap portable and has high temporal resolution to allow real-time operation. Due to its poor spatial specificity BCIs based on EEG can require extensive training and multiple trials to decode brain activity consequently slowing down the operation of the BCI. On the other hand BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI are more accurate owing to its superior spatial resolution and sensitivity to underlying neuronal processes which are functionally localized. However due to its relatively low temporal resolution high cost and lack of portability fMRI is unlikely to be used for routine BCI. We propose a new approach for transferring the capabilities of fMRI to EEG which includes simultaneous EEG/fMRI sessions for finding a mapping from EEG to fMRI followed by a BCI run from only EEG data but driven by fMRI-like features obtained from the mapping identified previously. Our novel data-driven method is likely to discover latent linkages between electrical and hemodynamic signatures of neural activity hitherto unexplored using model-driven methods and is likely to serve as a template for a novel multi-modal strategy wherein cross-modal EEG-fMRI interactions are exploited for the operation of a unimodal EEG system leading to a new generation of EEG-based BCIs.
