The proliferation of healthcare data has brought the opportunities of applying data-driven approaches such as machine learning methods to assist diagnosis. Recently many deep learning methods have been shown with impressive successes in predicting disease status with raw input data. However the "black-box" nature of deep learning and the highreliability requirement of biomedical applications have created new challenges regarding the existence of confounding factors. In this paper with a brief argument that inappropriate handling of confounding factors will lead to models\ sub-optimal performance in real-world applications we present an efficient method that can remove the inuences of confounding factors such as age or gender to improve the across-cohort prediction accuracy of neural networks. One distinct advantage of our method is that it only requires minimal changes of the baseline model\s architecture so that it can be plugged into most of the existing neural networks. We conduct experiments across CT-scan MRA and EEG brain wave with convolutional neural networks and LSTM to verify the efficiency of our method. Removing Confounding Factors Associated Weights in Deep Neural Networks Improves the Prediction Accuracy for Healthcare Applications.
