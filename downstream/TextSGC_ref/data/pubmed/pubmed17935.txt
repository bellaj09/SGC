Background: Compensatory movement such as flexing the trunk during reaching may negatively affect motor improvement during task-based practice for persons with stroke. Shaping or incrementally decreasing the amount of compensation used during rehabilitation may be a viable strategy with methods using virtual reality. Methods: A virtual reality tool was designed to 1 monitor upper extremity movement kinematics with an off-the-shelf motion sensor Microsoft Kinect V2 2 convert movements into control of widely available computer games and 3 provide real-time feedback to shape trunk compensation. This system was tested for feasibility by a small cohort of participants with chronic stroke n\u2009=\u20095 during a 1-h session involving 40\u2009min of virtual reality interaction. Outcomes related to repetitions compensation movement kinematics usability motivation and sense of presence were collected. Results: Participants achieved a very high dose of reaching repetitions 461\u2009\u2009184 with an average of 81% being successful and 19% involving compensatory trunk flexion. Participants rated the system as highly usable motivating engaging and safe. Conclusions: VRShape is feasible to use as a tool for increasing repetition rates measuring and shaping compensation and enhancing motivation for upper extremity therapy. Future research should focus on software improvements and investigation of efficacy during a virtual reality-based motor intervention.
