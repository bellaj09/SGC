RSVP Keyboard is an electroencephalography EEG based brain computer interface BCI typing system designed as an assistive technology for the communication needs of people with locked-in syndrome LIS. It relies on rapid serial visual presentation RSVP and does not require precise eye gaze control. Existing BCI typing systems which uses event related potentials ERP in EEG suffer from low accuracy due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Henceforth RSVP Keyboard utilizes a context based decision making via incorporating a language model to improve the accuracy of letter decisions. To further improve the contributions of the language model we propose recursive bayesian estimation which relies on non-committing string decisions and conduct an offline analysis which compares it with the existing nave bayesian fusion approach. The results indicate the superiority of the recursive bayesian fusion and in the next generation of RSVP Keyboard we plan to incorporate this new approach. Improved accuracy using recursive bayesian estimation based language model fusion in ERP-based BCI typing systems.
