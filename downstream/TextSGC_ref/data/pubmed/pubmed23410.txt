"Life expectancy is constantly increasing in developed countries. Unfortunately a longer life does not always correspond to a healthier life as even normal aging is associated with cognitive decline and increased risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. Episodic memory EM is one of the most vulnerable cognitive functions in aging and its decline is the hallmark of typical Alzheimers disease. This memory system is defined as the ability to acquire and recollect personally experienced episodes associated with a specific affective spatial and temporal context. However most of the neuropsychological and experimental tasks currently employed to assess EM consist in learning simple material e.g. list of words in highly stereotyped contexts. In the same vein classical paper-and-pencil or numeric remediation tools have shown their limitations in the transfer of acquired skills to daily life. Virtual reality VR thanks to its immersive properties and the possibility of delivering realistic and complex scenarios seems a promising tool to address the limitations of the assessment and remediation of EM. Here we review existing studies employing VR in normal and pathological aging to assess and reeducate EM. Overall we show that VR has been mainly used via non-immersive systems. Further studies should therefore test the impact of different degrees of immersion. Moreover there is a lack of VR remediation tools specifically targeting EM. We propose that future studies should fill this gap addressing in particular the adaptivity of VR remediation protocols."
