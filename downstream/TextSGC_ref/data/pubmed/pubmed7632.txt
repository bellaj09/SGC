Aiming at the problems of low efficiency and poor accuracy of traditional CAPTCHA recognition methods we have proposed a more efficient way based on deep convolutional neural network CNN. The Dense Convolutional Network DenseNet has shown excellent classification performance which adopts cross-layer connection. Not only it effectively alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem but also dramatically reduce the number of parameters. However it also has caused great memory consumption. So we improve and construct a new DenseNet for CAPTCHA recognition DFCR. Firstly we reduce the number of convolutional blocks and build corresponding classifiers for different types of CAPTCHA images. Secondly we input the CAPTCHA images of TFrecords format into the DFCR for model training. Finally we test the Chinese or English CAPTCHAs experimentally with different numbers of characters. Experiments show that the new network not only keeps the primary performance advantages of the DenseNets but also effectively reduces the memory consumption. Furthermore the recognition accuracy of CAPTCHA with the background noise and character adhesion is above 99.9%. CAPTCHA recognition based on deep convolutional neural network.
