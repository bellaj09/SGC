Deep learning DL methods and architectures have been the state-of-the-art classification algorithms for computer vision and natural language processing problems. However the successful application of these methods in motor imagery MI brain-computer interfaces BCIs in order to boost classification performance is still limited. In this paper we propose a classification framework for MI data by introducing a new temporal representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network CNN architecture for classification. The new representation is generated from modifying the filter-bank common spatial patterns method and the CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for the representation. Our framework outperforms the best classification method in the literature on the BCI competition IV-2a 4-class MI data set by 7% increase in average subject accuracy. Furthermore by studying the convolutional weights of the trained networks we gain an insight into the temporal characteristics of EEG.
