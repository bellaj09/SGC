Compared with traditional dental training methods virtual reality training systems integrated with multisensory feedback possess potentials advantages. However there exist many technical challenges in developing a satisfactory simulator. In this manuscript we systematically survey several current dental training systems to identify the gaps between the capabilities of these systems and the clinical training requirements. After briefly summarising the components functions and unique features of each system we discuss the technical challenges behind these systems including the software hardware and user evaluation methods. Finally the clinical requirements of an ideal dental training system are proposed. Future research/development areas are identified based on an analysis of the gaps between current systems and clinical training requirements. Survey on multisensory feedback virtual reality dental training systems.
