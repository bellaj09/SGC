It is difficult to understand nursing practically for students who have just started studying nursing because they cannot imagine the actual medical scene. The authors expect that they can improve nursing learning through experiences in virtual medical environments supported by ICT information and commnication technology. We developed teaching materials in nursing education and in a previous study we reported that the use of a virtual hospital was useful for students who had not had medical experience. The aim of the present study was to have students consider the meaning of a hospital room ceiling. First we showed them a few ceiling patterns and they selected the best one among the patterns. After that we showed the same one in a virtual hospital room. They had negative opinions about what they had thought was the best one at this time. This demonstrates that the virtual hospital room is effective when students evaluate the ceiling as a part of the hospital room.
