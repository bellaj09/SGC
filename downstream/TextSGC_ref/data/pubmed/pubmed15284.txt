Virtual worlds are emerging technologies that can enhance student learning by encouraging active participation through simulation in immersive environments. At Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine RUSVM the virtual world of Second Life was piloted as an educational platform for first-semester students to practice clinical reasoning in a simulated veterinary clinical setting. Under the supervision of one facilitator four groups of nine students met three times to process a clinical case using Second Life. In addition three groups of four clinical faculty observed one Second Life meeting. Questionnaires using a 4-point Likert scale 1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree and open-ended questions were used to assess student and clinical faculty perceptions of the Second Life platform. Perception scores of students M=2.7 SD=0.7 and clinical faculty M=2.7 SD=0.5 indicate that Second Life provides authentic and realistic learning experiences. In fact students M=3.4 SD=0.6 and clinical faculty M=2.9 SD=1.0 indicate that Second Life should be offered to future students. Moreover content analyses of open-ended responses from students and faculty support the use of Second Life based on reported advantages indicating that Second Life offers a novel and effective instructional method. Ultimately results indicate that students and clinical faculty had positive educational experiences using Second Life suggesting the need for further investigation into its application within the curriculum.
