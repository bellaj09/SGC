Face recognition FR with single sample per person SSPP is a challenge in computer vision. Since there is only one sample to be trained it makes facial variation such as pose illumination and disguise difficult to be predicted. To overcome this problem this paper proposes a scheme combined traditional and deep learning TDL method to process the task. First it proposes an expanding sample method based on traditional approach. Compared with other expanding sample methods the method can be used easily and conveniently. Besides it can generate samples such as disguise expression and mixed variation. Second it uses transfer learning and introduces a well-trained deep convolutional neural network DCNN model and then selects some expanding samples to fine-tune the DCNN model. Third the fine-tuned model is used to implement experiment. Experimental results on AR face database Extend Yale B face database FERET face database and LFW database demonstrate that TDL achieves the state-of-the-art performance in SSPP FR.
