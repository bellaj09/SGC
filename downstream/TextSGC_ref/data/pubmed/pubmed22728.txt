Glial scar encapsulation is thought to be one of the major reasons for the failure of chronic brain-machine interfaces. Many strategies including modification of the probe surface chemistry delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs and changes of probe geometry have been employed to reduce glial scar formation. We have proposed that a possible means to establish long-term reliable communication across the scar is the in situ polymerization of conjugated polymers such as PEDOT in neural tissue. Previously we exposed entire brain slices to the EDOT monomer. Here we demonstrate that PEDOT can be polymerized by the direct delivery of EDOT monomer to the reaction site. The monomer was delivered into rat cortex via microcannula and simultaneously electrochemically polymerized within the tissue using a microwire electrode. We found that the resulting PEDOT polymer cloud grew out from the working electrode tip and extended far out into the brain tissue spanning distances more than 1mm. We also examined the morphology of resulting polymer cloud by optical microscopy. Direct local polymerization of poly34-ethylenedioxythiophene in rat cortex.
