The use of virtual reality VR simulation for surgical training has gathered much interest in recent years. Despite increasing popularity and usage limited work has been carried out in the use of automated objective measures to quantify the extent to which performance in a simulator resembles performance in the operating theatre and the effects of simulator training on real world performance. To this end we present a study exploring the effects of VR training on the performance of dentistry students learning a novel oral surgery task. We compare the performance of trainees in a VR simulator and in a physical setting involving ovine jaws using a range of automated metrics derived by motion analysis. Our results suggest that simulator training improved the motion economy of trainees without adverse effects on task outcome. Comparison of surgical technique on the simulator with the ovine setting indicates that simulator technique is similar but not identical to real world technique.
