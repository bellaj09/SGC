Far space and near space refer to different spatial features in which we unfold our behaviour. On the one hand classical visuospatial neuropsychological tests assess spatial abilities in the near space; on the other far space typically involves new spatial memory tasks in which participants display their behaviour in an environment either interacting with objects or searching for targets. The Boxes Room Task is a virtual test that assesses spatial memory in the far space. Based upon this task a new test was developed in which participants could not move about within the context but they could actually perceive it from a specific viewpoint. In this work both versions of the task were compared with one another. Furthermore they were also compared with the results of 10/36 spatial recall test a task assessing spatial memory in the near space. Two conditions were applied in all tasks both in stable and rotated contexts. Our study included one hundred and twenty healthy young participants who were divided into two groups. The first group performed the Walking Space Boxes Room Task. A second group performed the Non-Walking Space Boxes Room Task as well as another traditional neuropsychological test for near space assessment the 10/36 spatial recall test. Results proved that orientation in the non-walking space was more difficult than in the walking space. Additionally our test also showed that men outperformed women in both virtual reality-based tasks although they did not do it in the traditional 10/36 spatial recall test. In short this work exposes that virtual-reality technologies provide tools to assess spatial memory being more sensitive than traditional tests in the detection of small performance changes. Virtual reality assessment of walking and non-walking space in men and women with virtual reality-based tasks.
