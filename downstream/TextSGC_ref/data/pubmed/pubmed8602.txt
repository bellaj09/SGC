In recent years artificial intelligence AI and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data e.g. sensor data from various sources in different applications such as those for the Internet of Things IoT which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system GIS accelerometers as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system GNSS and global positioning system GPS. The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.
