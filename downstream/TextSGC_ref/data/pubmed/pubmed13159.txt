"Freezing of gait FOG is one of the most incapacitating motor symptoms in Parkinsons disease PD. The occurrence of FOG reduces the patients quality of live and leads to falls. FOG assessment has usually been made through questionnaires however this method can be subjective and could not provide an accurate representation of the severity of this symptom. The use of sensor-based systems can provide accurate and objective information to track the symptoms evolution to optimize PD management and treatments. Several authors have proposed specific methods based on wearables and the analysis of inertial signals to detect FOG in laboratory conditions however its performance is usually lower when being used at patients homes. This study presents a new approach based on a recurrent neural network RNN and a single waist-worn triaxial accelerometer to enhance the FOG detection performance to be used in real home-environments. Also several machine and deep learning approaches for FOG detection are evaluated using a leave-one-subject-out LOSO cross-validation. Results show that modeling spectral information of adjacent windows through an RNN can bring a significant improvement in the performance of FOG detection without increasing the length of the analysis window required to using it as a cue-system."
