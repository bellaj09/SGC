The aim of this study is to assess social personality and behaviors of alcoholics using Virtual Reality VR. Specifically we defined a VR protocol using the free NeuroVR software -- http://www.neurovr.org -- to investigate the following factors: drinking behaviors intrapersonal factors Emotional Management and Self Esteem and environmental factors Relational Competences and Social Pressure. In this preliminary study we evaluated the difference between assessment methods by comparing the VR assessment protocol with the SCID - Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders - in a sample of 20 alcohol-dependent individuals 10 experimental group + 10 control group entering a non-pharmacological outpatient treatment. The data obtained using both qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the possibility of using the VR protocol in the assessment of alcohol-dependent patients: the therapist obtains more critical data about behaviors and attitudes in less time. Further the VR group reported a significant improvement in the motivation for change after the assessment protocol not found in the SCID group: apparently the experiential approach required by VR makes the patient more active and involved in the processes of introspection and change. A wider sample and a multicentric trial are now needed to confirm these results. Why do you drink? Virtual reality as an experiential medium for the assessment of alcohol-dependent individuals.
