Convolutional neural networks CNNs have rapidly become the state-of-the-art models for image classification applications. They usually require large groundtruthed datasets for training. Here we address object identification and recognition in the wild for infrared IR imaging in defense applications where no such large-scale dataset is available. With a focus on robustness issues especially viewpoint invariance we introduce a compact and fully convolutional CNN architecture with global average pooling. We show that this model trained from realistic simulation datasets reaches a state-of-the-art performance compared with other CNNs with no data augmentation and fine-tuning steps. We also demonstrate a significant improvement in the robustness to viewpoint changes with respect to an operational support vector machine SVM-based scheme.
