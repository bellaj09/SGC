The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain-computer interfaces BCIs for gait rehabilitation. While the feasibility of closed-loop BCI systems for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a BCI virtual reality BCI-VR environment has yet to be demonstrated. BCI-VR systems provide valuable alternatives for movement rehabilitation when wearable robots are not desirable due to medical conditions cost accessibility usability or patient preferences.
