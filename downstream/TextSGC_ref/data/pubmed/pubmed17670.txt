How do we segment and recognize novel objects? When explicit cues from motion and color are available object boundary detection is relatively easy. However under conditions of deep camouflage in which objects share the same image cues as their background the visual system must reassign new functional roles to existing image statistics in order to group continuities for detection and segmentation of object boundaries. This bootstrapped learning process is stimulus dependent and requires extensive task-specific training. Using a between-subject design we tested participants on their ability to segment and recognize novel objects after a consolidation period of sleep or wake. We found a specific role for rapid eye movement REM n = 43 sleep in context-invariant novel object learning and that REM sleep as well as a period of active wake AW n = 35 increased segmentation of context-specific object learning compared to a period of quiet wake QW n = 38; p = .007 and p = .017 respectively. Performance in the non-REM nap group n = 32 was not different from the other groups. The REM sleep enhancement effect was especially robust for the top performing quartile of subjects or "super learners" p = .037. Together these results suggest that the construction and generalization of novel representations through bootstrapped learning may benefit from REM sleep and more specific object learning may also benefit from AW. We discuss these results in the context of shared electrophysiological and neurochemical features of AW and REM sleep which are distinct from QW and non-REM sleep.
