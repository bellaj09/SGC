Hemineglect defined as a failure to attend to the contralesional side of space is a prevalent and disabling post-stroke deficit. Conventional hemineglect assessments lack sensitivity as they contain mainly non-functional tasks performed in near-extrapersonal space using static two-dimensional methods. This is of concern given that hemineglect is a strong predictor for functional deterioration limited post-stroke recovery and difficulty in community reintegration. With the emerging field of virtual reality several virtual tools have been proposed and have reported better sensitivity in neglect-related deficits detection than conventional methods. However these and future virtual reality-based tools are yet to be implemented in clinical practice. Exploring barriers and facilitators to the clinical use of virtual reality for post-stroke unilateral spatial neglect assessment.
