T1-weighted image T1WI and T2-weighted image T2WI are the two routinely acquired Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI protocols that provide complementary information for diagnosis. However the total acquisition time of ~10 min yields the image quality vulnerable to artifacts such as motion. To speed up MRI process various algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct high quality images from under-sampled k-space data. These algorithms only employ the information of an individual protocol e.g. T2WI. In this paper we propose to combine complementary MRI protocols i.e. T1WI and under-sampled T2WI particularly to reconstruct the high-quality image i.e. fully-sampled T2WI. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to utilize data from different MRI protocols to speed up the reconstruction of a target sequence. Specifically we present a novel deep learning approach namely Dense-Unet to accomplish the reconstruction task. The Dense-Unet requires fewer parameters and less computation but achieves better performance. Our results have shown that Dense-Unet can reconstruct a 3D T2WI volume in less than 10 s i.e. with the acceleration rate as high as 8 or more but with negligible aliasing artefacts and signal-noise-ratio SNR loss.
