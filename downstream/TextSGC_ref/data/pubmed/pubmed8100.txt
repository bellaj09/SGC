We report a deep learning-enabled field-portable and cost-effective imaging flow cytometer that automatically captures phase-contrast color images of the contents of a continuously flowing water sample at a throughput of 100\u2009mL/h. The device is based on partially coherent lens-free holographic microscopy and acquires the diffraction patterns of flowing micro-objects inside a microfluidic channel. These holographic diffraction patterns are reconstructed in real time using a deep learning-based phase-recovery and image-reconstruction method to produce a color image of each micro-object without the use of external labeling. Motion blur is eliminated by simultaneously illuminating the sample with red green and blue light-emitting diodes that are pulsed. Operated by a laptop computer this portable device measures 15.5\u2009cm\u2009\u200915\u2009cm\u2009\u200912.5\u2009cm weighs 1\u2009kg and compared to standard imaging flow cytometers it provides extreme reductions of cost size and weight while also providing a high volumetric throughput over a large object size range. We demonstrated the capabilities of this device by measuring ocean samples at the Los Angeles coastline and obtaining images of its micro- and nanoplankton composition. Furthermore we measured the concentration of a potentially toxic alga Pseudo-nitzschia in six public beaches in Los Angeles and achieved good agreement with measurements conducted by the California Department of Public Health. The cost-effectiveness compactness and simplicity of this computational platform might lead to the creation of a network of imaging flow cytometers for large-scale and continuous monitoring of the ocean microbiome including its plankton composition. A deep learning-enabled portable imaging flow cytometer for cost-effective high-throughput and label-free analysis of natural water samples.
