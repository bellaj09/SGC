The advancements in and affordability of technologies offer increasing opportunities to modernise healthcare education into packages developed to meet the expectations and requirements of the digital generation. Purposefully designed and tested Virtual Reality Learning Environments VRLE can offer healthcare students the means to access and revisit learning materials in ways that enhance education and meet a range of needs; including those with specific learning differences and those who have traditionally been disenfranchised. Furthermore this will make healthcare education much more readily available to those who have been previously marginalised by distance. This paper argues that Virtual Reality VR has the unique potential to transform healthcare education and suggests that more providers should consider collaborating with developers and investing in the technology.
