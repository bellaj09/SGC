Segmentation of organs from chest X-ray images is an essential task for an accurate and reliable diagnosis of lung diseases and chest organ morphometry. In this study we investigated the benefits of augmenting state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks CNNs for image segmentation with organ contour information and evaluated the performance of such augmentation on segmentation of lung fields heart and clavicles from chest X-ray images. Contour-aware multi-label chest X-ray organ segmentation.
