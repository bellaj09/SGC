Motor speech disorders including apraxia of speech AOS account for over 50% of the communication disorders following stroke. Given its prevalence and impact and the need to understand its neural mechanisms we used resting state functional MRI to examine functional connectivity within a network of regions previously hypothesized as being associated with AOS bilateral anterior insula aINS inferior frontal gyrus IFG and ventral premotor cortex PM in a group of 32 left hemisphere stroke patients and 18 healthy age-matched controls. Two expert clinicians rated severity of AOS dysarthria and nonverbal oral apraxia of the patients. Fifteen individuals were categorized as AOS and 17 were AOS-absent. Comparison of connectivity in patients with and without AOS demonstrated that AOS patients had reduced connectivity between bilateral PM and this reduction correlated with the severity of AOS impairment. In addition AOS patients had negative connectivity between the left PM and right aINS and this effect decreased with increasing severity of non-verbal oral apraxia. These results highlight left PM involvement in AOS begin to differentiate its neural mechanisms from those of other motor impairments following stroke and help inform us of the neural mechanisms driving differences in speech motor planning and programming impairment following stroke. Altered resting-state network connectivity in stroke patients with and without apraxia of speech.
