"Driver fatigue is an important cause of traffic accidents which has triggered great concern for detecting drivers fatigue. Numerous methods have been proposed to fulll this challenging task including feature methods and machine learning methods. Recently with the development of deep learning techniques many studies achieved better results than traditional feature methods and the combination of traditional methods and deep learning techniques gradually received attention. In this paper we propose a recurrence network-based convolutional neural network RN-CNN method to detect fatigue driving. To be specific we first conduct a simulated driving experiment to collect electroencephalogram EEG signals of subjects under alert state and fatigue state. Then we construct the multiplex recurrence network RN from EEG signals to fuse information from the original time series. Finally CNN is employed to extract and learn the features of a multiplex RN for realizing a classification task. The results indicate that the proposed RN-CNN method can achieve an average accuracy of 92.95%. To verify the effectiveness of our method some existing competitive methods are compared with ours. The results show that our method outperforms the existing methods which demonstrate the effect of the RN-CNN method."
