"Recognizing activities of daily living ADL provides vital contextual information that enhances the effectiveness of various mobile health and wellness applications. Development of wearable motion sensors along with machine learning algorithms offer a great opportunity for ADL recognition. However the performance of the ADL recognition systems may significantly degrade when they are used by a new user due to inter-subject variability. This issue limits the usability of these systems. In this paper we propose a deep learning assisted personalization framework for ADL recognition with the aim to maximize the personalization performance while minimizing solicitation of inputs or labels from the user to reduce users burden. The proposed framework consists of unsupervised retraining of automatic feature extraction layers and supervised fine-tuning of classification layers through a novel active learning model based on a given models uncertainty. We design a Bayesian deep convolutional neural network with stochastic latent variables that allows us to estimate both aleatoric data-dependent and epistemic model-dependent uncertainties in recognition task. In this study for the first time we show how distinguishing between the two aforementioned sources of uncertainty leads to more effective active learning. The experimental results show that our proposed method improves the accuracy of ADL recognition on a new user by 25% on average compared to the case of using a model for a new user with no personalization with an average final accuracy of 89.2%. Moreover our method achieves higher personalization accuracy while significantly reducing users burden in terms of soliciting inputs and labels compared to other methods."
