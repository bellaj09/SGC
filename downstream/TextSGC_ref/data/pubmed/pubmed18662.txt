The introduction of computer-based training systems for laparoscopic surgery has increased the training quality and made the learning effect measurable with objective criteria. This paper introduces VSOne as a fully-featured virtual reality training system for laparoscopic surgery. VSOne utilizes the state-of-the-art in virtual reality techniques soft tissue simulation and haptic device control and guarantees realistic training possibilities for various laparoscopic procedures. An authoring software helps to create individual simulation models easily within the shortest time based on real patient data using standardized data formats. We have developed several Basic Task Training BTT modules to improve dexterity and complex Surgical Procedure Task SPT modules for full training of laparoscopic procedures such as cholecystectomy tubal sterilization and myomectomy. VSOne has been evaluated in a comparative study with classic training methods and has shown the typical learning curves for inexperienced trainees and the transferability of the learning effect to the real-world situation. VSOne a virtual reality simulator for laparoscopic surgery.
