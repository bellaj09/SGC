We study the feasibility of a hybrid Brain-Computer Interface BCI combining simultaneous visual oddball and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential SSVEP paradigms where both types of stimuli are superimposed on a computer screen. Potentially such a combination could result in a system being able to operate faster than a purely P300-based BCI and encode more targets than a purely SSVEP-based BCI. Simultaneous detection of P300 and steady-state visually evoked potentials for hybrid brain-computer interface.
