Quantification of the human rod and cone photoreceptor mosaic in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope AOSLO images is useful for the study of various retinal pathologies. Subjective and time-consuming manual grading has remained the gold standard for evaluating these images with no well validated automatic methods for detecting individual rods having been developed. We present a novel deep learning based automatic method called the rod and cone CNN RAC-CNN for detecting and classifying rods and cones in multimodal AOSLO images. We test our method on images from healthy subjects as well as subjects with achromatopsia over a range of retinal eccentricities. We show that our method is on par with human grading for detecting rods and cones.
