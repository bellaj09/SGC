Glia play important roles in neural function including but not limited to amino acid recycling ion homeostasis glucose metabolism and waste removal. During retinal degeneration and subsequent retinal remodeling Mller cells MCs are the first cells to show metabolic and morphological alterations in response to stress. Metabolic alterations in MCs chaotically progress in retina undergoing photoreceptor degeneration; however what relationship these alterations have with neuronal stress synapse maintenance or glia-glia interactions is currently unknown. The work described here reconstructs a MC from a pathoconnectome of early retinal remodeling retinal pathoconnectome 1 RPC1 and explores relationships between MC structural and metabolic phenotypes in the context of neighboring neurons and glia. Here we find variations in intensity of osmication inter- and intracellularly variation in small molecule metabolic content of MCs as well as morphological alterations of glial endfeet. RPC1 provides a framework to analyze these relationships in early retinal remodeling through ultrastructural reconstructions of both neurons and glia. These reconstructions informed by quantitative metabolite labeling via computational molecular phenotyping CMP allow us to evaluate neural-glial interactions in early retinal degeneration with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.
