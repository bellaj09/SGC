Image Super-Resolution SR is an important class of image processing techniques to enhance the resolution of images and videos in computer vision. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress of image super-resolution using deep learning techniques. In this survey we aim to give a survey on recent advances of image super-resolution techniques using deep learning approaches in a systematic way. In general we can roughly group the existing studies of SR techniques into three major categories: supervised SR unsupervised SR and domain-specific SR. In addition we also cover some other important issues such as publicly available benchmark datasets and performance evaluation metrics. Finally we conclude this survey by highlighting several future directions and open issues which should be further addressed by the community in the future.
