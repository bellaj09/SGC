"An array of sensors including an HD camera mounted on a Fixed Underwater Observatory FUO were used to monitor a cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa reef in the Lofoten-Vesterlen area from April to November 2015. Image processing and deep learning enabled extraction of time series describing changes in coral colour and polyp activity feeding. The image data was analysed together with data from the other sensors from the same period to provide new insights into the short- and long-term dynamics in polyp features. The results indicate that diurnal variations and tidal current influenced polyp activity by controlling the food supply. On a longer time-scale the corals tissue colour changed from white in the spring to slightly red during the summer months which can be explained by a seasonal change in food supply. Our work shows that using an effective integrative computational approach the image time series is a new and rich source of information to understand and monitor the dynamics in underwater environments due to the high temporal resolution and coverage enabled with FUOs." Computer vision enables short- and long-term analysis of Lophelia pertusa polyp behaviour and colour from an underwater observatory.
