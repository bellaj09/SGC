"This article presents the results of an investigation of the construct validity of J. B. Biggss 1987 theory of learning approaches and of R. J. Sternbergs 1988 theory of thinking styles in two Chinese populations. The study is also an examination of the nature of the relations between the two theories. University students from Hong Kong n = 854 and from Nanjing mainland China n = 215 completed the Study Process Questionnaire J. B. Biggs 1992 and the Thinking Styles Inventory R. J. Sternberg & R. K. Wagner 1992. Results indicated that both inventories were reliable and valid for assessing the constructs underlying their respective theories among both Hong Kong and Nanjing university students. Results also showed that the learning approaches and thinking styles are related in the hypothesized ways: The surface approach was hypothesized to be positively and significantly correlated with styles associated with less complexity and negatively and significantly correlated with the legislative judicial liberal and hierarchical styles. The deep approach was hypothesized to be positively and significantly correlated with styles associated with more complexity and negatively and significantly correlated with the executive conservative local and monarchic styles. Implications of these relations are discussed." Are learning approaches and thinking styles related? A study in two Chinese populations.
