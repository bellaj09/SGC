Geolocators are a well-established technology to reconstruct migration routes of animals that are too small to carry satellite tags e.g. passerine birds. These devices record environmental light-level data that enable the reconstruction of daily positions from the time of twilight. However all current methods for analysing geolocator data require manual pre-processing of raw records to eliminate twilight events showing unnatural variation in light levels a step that is time-consuming and must be accomplished by a trained expert. Here we propose and implement advanced machine learning techniques to automate this procedure and we apply them to 108 migration tracks of barn swallows  Hirundo rustica. We show that routes reconstructed from the automated pre-processing are comparable to those obtained from manual selection accomplished by a human expert. This raises the possibility of fully automating light-level geolocator data analysis and possibly analysing the large amount of data already collected on several species.
