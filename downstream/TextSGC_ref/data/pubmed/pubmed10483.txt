The displacement of the hyoid bone is one of the key components evaluated in the swallow study as its motion during swallowing is related to overall swallowing integrity. In daily research settings experts visually detect the hyoid bone in the video frames and manually plot hyoid bone position frame by frame. This study aims to develop an automatic method to localize the location of the hyoid bone in the video sequence. To automatically detect the location of the hyoid bone in a frame we proposed a single shot multibox detector a deep convolutional neural network which is employed to detect and classify the location of the hyoid bone. We also evaluated the performance of two other state-of-art detection methods for comparison. The experimental results clearly showed that the single shot multibox detector can detect the hyoid bone with an average precision of 89.14% and outperform other auto-detection algorithms. We conclude that this automatic hyoid bone tracking system is accurate enough to be widely applied as a pre-processing step for image processing in dysphagia research as well as a promising development that may be useful in the diagnosis of dysphagia.
