Brain-machine interfaces BMIs are dynamical systems whose properties ultimately influence performance. For instance a 2-D BMI in which cursor position is controlled using a Kalman filter will by default create an attractor point that "pulls" the cursor to particular points in the workspace. If created unintentionally such effects may not be beneficial for BMI performance. However there have been few empirical studies exploring how various dynamical effects of closed-loop BMIs ultimately influence performance. In this work we utilize experimental data from two macaque monkeys operating a closed-loop BMI to reach to 2-D targets and show that certain dynamical properties correlate with performance loss. We also show that other dynamical properties represent tradeoffs between naturally competing objectives such as speed versus accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning the dynamical properties of closed-loop BMIs to optimize task-specific performance.
