Brain-computer interfaces BCIs are widely used for clinical applications and exploited to design robotic and interactive systems for healthy people. We provide evidence to control a sensorimotor electroencephalographic EEG BCI system while piloting a flight simulator and attending a double attentional task simultaneously. Ten healthy subjects were trained to learn how to manage a flight simulator use the BCI system and answer to the attentional tasks independently. Afterward the EEG activity was collected during a first flight where subjects were required to concurrently use the BCI and a second flight where they were required to simultaneously use the BCI and answer to the attentional tasks. Results showed that the concurrent use of the BCI system during the flight simulation does not affect the flight performances. However BCI performances decrease from the 83 to 63\xa0% while attending additional alertness and vigilance tasks. This work shows that it is possible to successfully control a BCI system during the execution of multiple tasks such as piloting a flight simulator with an extra cognitive load induced by attentional tasks. Such framework aims to foster the knowledge on BCI systems embedded into vehicles and robotic devices to allow the simultaneous execution of secondary tasks. Investigation of the effect of EEG-BCI on the simultaneous execution of flight simulation and attentional tasks.
