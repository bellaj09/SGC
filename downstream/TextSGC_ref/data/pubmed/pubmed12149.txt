"Trained pathologists base colorectal cancer identification on the visual interpretation of microscope images. However image labeling is not always straightforward and this repetitive task is prone to mistakes due to human distraction. Significant efforts are underway to develop informative tools to assist pathologists and decrease the burden and frequency of errors. The present study proposes a deep learning approach to recognize four different stages of cancerous tissue development including normal mucosa early preneoplastic lesion adenoma and cancer. A dataset of human colon tissue images collected and labeled over a 10-year period by a team of pathologists was partitioned into three sets. These were used to train validate and test the neural network comprising several convolutional and a few linear layers. The approach used in the present study is direct; it labels raw images and bypasses the segmentation step. An overall accuracy of >95% was achieved with the majority of mislabeling referring to a near category. Tests on an external dataset with a different resolution yielded accuracies >80%. The present study demonstrated that the neural network when properly trained can provide fast accurate and reproducible labeling for colon cancer images with the potential to significantly improve the quality and speed of medical diagnoses."
