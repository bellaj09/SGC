Multiple myeloma is an incurable and fatal cancer of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Most conventional therapies aim to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells but resistance to these drugs often arises and drives relapse. In this study we sought to identify the best adjunct targets to kill myeloma cells resistant to conventional therapies using deep profiling by mass cytometry CyTOF. We validated probes to simultaneously detect 26 regulators of cell death mitosis cell signaling and cancer-related pathways at the single-cell level following treatment of myeloma cells with dexamethasone or bortezomib. Time-resolved visualization algorithms and machine learning random forest models RFMs delineated putative cell death trajectories and a hierarchy of parameters that specified myeloma cell survival versus apoptosis following treatment. Among these parameters increased amounts of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein CREB and the pro-survival protein MCL-1 were defining features of cells surviving drug treatment. Importantly the RFM prediction that the combination of an MCL-1 inhibitor with dexamethasone would elicit potent synergistic killing of myeloma cells was validated in other cell lines in vivo preclinical models and primary myeloma samples from patients. Furthermore CyTOF analysis of patient bone marrow cells clearly identified myeloma cells and their key cell survival features. This study demonstrates the utility of CyTOF profiling at the single-cell level to identify clinically relevant drug combinations and tracking of patient responses for future clinical trials. Deep profiling of apoptotic pathways with mass cytometry identifies a synergistic drug combination for killing myeloma cells.
