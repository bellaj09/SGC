In this study we conducted an offline analysis of transcranial Doppler TCD ultrasound recordings to investigate potential methods for increasing data transmission rate in a TCD-based brain-computer interface. Cerebral blood flow velocity was recorded within the left and right middle cerebral arteries while nine able-bodied participants alternated between rest and two different mental activities word generation and mental rotation. We differentiated these three states using a three-class linear discriminant analysis classifier while the duration of each state was varied between 5 and 30s. Maximum classification accuracies exceeded 70% and data transmission rate was maximized at 1.2 bits per minute representing a four-fold increase in data transmission rate over previous two-class analysis of TCD recordings. Towards increased data transmission rate for a three-class metabolic brain-computer interface based on transcranial Doppler ultrasound.
