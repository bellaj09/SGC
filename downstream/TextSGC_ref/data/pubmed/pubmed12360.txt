Though active-learning instruction has the potential to positively impact the preparation and diversity of STEM graduates not all instructors are able to achieve this potential. One important factor is the teacher knowledge that instructors possess including their pedagogical knowledge. Pedagogical knowledge is the knowledge about teaching and learning that is not topic-specific such as knowledge of learning theory classroom management and student motivation. We investigated the pedagogical knowledge that 77 instructors who report implementing active-learning instruction used as they analyzed video clips of lessons in large active-learning biology courses. We used qualitative content analysis and drew on cognitive and sociocultural perspectives of learning to identify and characterize the pedagogical knowledge instructors employed. We used the collective thinking of these instructors to generate a framework of pedagogical knowledge for active-learning instruction in large undergraduate biology courses. Pedagogical knowledge for active-learning instruction in large undergraduate biology courses: a large-scale qualitative investigation of instructor thinking.
