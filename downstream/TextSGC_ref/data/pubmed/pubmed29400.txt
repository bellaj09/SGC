"While promising for many applications electroencephalography EEG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs are still scarcely used outside laboratories due to a poor reliability. It is thus necessary to study and fix this reliability issue. Doing so requires the use of appropriate reliability metrics to quantify both the classification algorithm and the BCI users performances. So far classification accuracy CA is the typical metric used for both aspects. However we argue in this paper that CA is a poor metric to study BCI users skills. Here we propose a definition and new metrics to quantify such BCI skills for mental imagery MI BCIs independently of any classification algorithm."
