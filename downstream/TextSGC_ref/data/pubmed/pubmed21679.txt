Depth camera such as Microsoft Kinect is much cheaper than conventional 3D scanning devices and thus it can be acquired for everyday users easily. However the depth data captured by Kinect over a certain distance is of extreme low quality. In this paper we present a novel scanning system for capturing 3D full human body models by using multiple Kinects. To avoid the interference phenomena we use two Kinects to capture the upper part and lower part of a human body respectively without overlapping region. A third Kinect is used to capture the middle part of the human body from the opposite direction. We propose a practical approach for registering the various body parts of different views under non-rigid deformation. First a rough mesh template is constructed and used to deform successive frames pairwisely. Second global alignment is performed to distribute errors in the deformation space which can solve the loop closure problem efficiently. Misalignment caused by complex occlusion can also be handled reasonably by our global alignment algorithm. The experimental results have shown the efficiency and applicability of our system. Our system obtains impressive results in a few minutes with low price devices thus is practically useful for generating personalized avatars for everyday users. Our system has been used for 3D human animation and virtual try on and can further facilitate a range of home&#8211;oriented virtual reality VR applications.
