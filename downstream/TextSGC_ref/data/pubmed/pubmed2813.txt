"Parkinsons disease is characterized by the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic signaling and the presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates also called Lewy bodies and neurites throughout the brain. In 2003 Braak and colleagues created a staging system for Parkinsons disease describing the connection between the alpha-synuclein pathology and disease severity. Later they suggested that the pathology might initially be triggered by exogenous insults targeting the gut and olfactory system. In 2008 we and other groups documented Lewy pathology in grafted neurons in people with Parkinsons disease who had been transplanted over a decade prior to autopsy. We proposed that the Lewy pathology in the grafted neurons was the result of permissive templating or prion-like spread of alpha-synuclein pathology from neurons in the host to those in the grafts. During the following ten\xa0years several studies described the transmission of alpha-synuclein pathology between neurons both in cell culture and in experimental animals. Recent research has also begun to identify underlying molecular mechanisms. Collectively these experimental studies tentatively support the idea that the progression from one Braak stage to the next is the consequence of prion-like propagation of Lewy pathology. However definitive proof that intercellular propagation of alpha-synuclein pathology occurs in Parkinsons disease cases has proven difficult to secure. In this review we highlight several open questions that currently prevent us from concluding with certainty that prion-like transfer of alpha-synuclein contributes to the progression of Parkinsons disease."
