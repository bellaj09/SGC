Brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF has been discussed to be involved in plasticity processes in the human brain in particular during aging. Recently aging and its neurodegenerative diseases have increasingly been conceptualized as disconnection syndromes. Here connectivity changes in neural networks the connectome are suggested to be the most relevant and characteristic features for such processes or diseases. To further elucidate the impact of aging on neural networks we investigated the interaction between plasticity processes brain connectivity and healthy aging by measuring levels of serum BDNF and resting-state fMRI data in 25 young mean age 24.8  2.7 SD years and 23 old healthy participants mean age 68.6  4.1\xa0years. To identify neural hubs most essentially related to serum BDNF we applied graph theory approaches namely the new data-driven and parameter-free approach eigenvector centrality EC mapping. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between serum BDNF and EC in the premotor and motor cortex in older participants in contrast to young volunteers where we did not detect any association. This positive relationship between serum BDNF and EC appears to be specific for older adults. Our results might indicate that the amount of physical activity and learning capacities leading to higher BDNF levels increases brain connectivity in premotor areas in healthy aging in agreement with rodent animal studies. Pilot results have to be replicated in a larger sample including behavioral data to disentangle the cause for the relationship between BDNF levels and connectivity. Serum BDNF correlates with connectivity in the premotor hub in the aging human brain--a resting-state fMRI pilot study.
