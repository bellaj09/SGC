"Auditory-sensorimotor coupling is critical for musical performance during which auditory and somatosensory feedback signals are used to ensure desired outputs. Previous studies reported opercular activation in subjects performing or listening to music. A functional connectivity analysis suggested the parietal operculum PO as a connector hub that links auditory somatosensory and motor cortical areas. We therefore examined whether this PO network differs between musicians and non-musicians. We analyzed resting-state PO functional connectivity with Heschls gyrus HG the planum temporale PT the precentral gyrus preCG and the postcentral gyrus postCG in 35 musicians and 35 non-musicians. In musicians the left PO exhibited increased functional connectivity with the ipsilateral HG PT preCG and postCG whereas the right PO exhibited enhanced functional connectivity with the contralateral HG preCG and postCG and the ipsilateral postCG. Direct functional connectivity between an auditory area the HG or PT and a sensorimotor area the preCG or postCG did not significantly differ between the groups. The POs functional connectivity with auditory and sensorimotor areas is enhanced in musicians relative to non-musicians. We propose that the PO network facilitates musical performance by mediating multimodal integration for modulating auditory-sensorimotor control."
