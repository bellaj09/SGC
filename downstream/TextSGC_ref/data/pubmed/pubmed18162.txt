"Establishing verbal memory traces for non-verbal stimuli was reported to facilitate or inhibit memory for the non-verbal stimuli. We show that these effects are also observed in a domain not indicated before-wayfinding. Fifty-three participants followed a guided route in a virtual environment. They were asked to remember half of the intersections by relying on the visual impression only. At the other 50% of the intersections participants additionally heard a place name which they were asked to memorize. For testing participants were teleported to the intersections and were asked to indicate the subsequent direction of the learned route. In Experiment 1 intersections names were arbitrary i.e. not related to the visual impression. Here participants performed more accurately at unnamed intersections. In Experiment 2 intersections names were descriptive and participants route memory was more accurate at named intersections. Results have implications for naming places in a city and for wayfinding aids." How to Best Name a Place?
