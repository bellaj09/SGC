"The importance of an early rehabilitation process in children with cerebral palsy CP is widely recognized. On the one hand new and useful treatment tools such as rehabilitation systems based on interactive technologies have appeared for rehabilitation of gross motor movements. On the other hand from the therapeutic point of view performing rehabilitation exercises with the facial muscles can improve the swallowing process the facial expression through the management of muscles in the face and even the speech of children with cerebral palsy. However it is difficult to find interactive games to improve the detection and evaluation of oral-facial musculature dysfunctions in children with CP. This paper describes a framework based on strategies developed for interactive serious games that is created both for typically developed children and children with disabilities. Four interactive games are the core of a Virtual Environment called SONRIE. This paper demonstrates the benefits of SONRIE to monitor childrens oral-facial difficulties. The next steps will focus on the validation of SONRIE to carry out the rehabilitation process of oral-facial musculature in children with cerebral palsy." A Virtual Environment to Improve the Detection of Oral-Facial Malfunction in Children with Cerebral Palsy.
