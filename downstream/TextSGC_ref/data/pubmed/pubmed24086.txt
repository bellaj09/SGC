Despite the longstanding discussion around the link between psychopathy and fearlessness few studies have explicitly tested this association and results have been mixed. This may be due in part to the lack of specificity in fear assessment. Further the relation between psychopathy and fear may be better understood using the two-factor model because in theory fear has opposing associations with interpersonal-affective Factor 1 and impulsive-antisocial Factor 2 traits. The present study aimed to test if the two factors of psychopathy are deferentially related to fear reactivity. To examine this we collected sympathetic SNS; skin conductance and parasympathetic PNS; respiratory sinus arrhythmia nervous system reactivity to an interactive virtual reality horror video in a nonclinical sample N\xa0=\xa0103. Also we included measures of emotional reactivity to fear and self-report of situational fear. Results indicated that coinhibition i.e. low PNS and SNS of the two physiological systems predicted Factor 1 suggesting that individuals high on Factor 1 showed little change in both branches of the autonomic nervous system in response to fear. In contrast Factor 2 was predicted by high PNS reactivity suggesting a vulnerability to emotion dysregulation. On emotional reactivity Factor 1 was related to feeling happier after the fear condition whereas Factor 2 was related to feeling less in control. Factor 1 was inversely associated with situational fear specifically lower scores of social phobias fear of aggression and physical injury. In summary the results provide evidence that psychopathy is related to fearlessness; however this is unique to the personality features of psychopathy.
