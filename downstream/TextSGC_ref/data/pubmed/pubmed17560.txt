"This article presents interactive visualizations to support the comprehension of spatial relationships between virtual and real world objects for Augmented Reality AR applications. To enhance the clarity of such relationships we discuss visualization techniques and their suitability for AR. We apply them on different AR applications with different goals e.g. in X-Ray vision or in applications which draw a users attention to an object of interest. We demonstrate how Focus and Context F+C visualizations are used to affect the users perception of hidden or nearby objects by presenting contextual information in the area of augmentation. We discuss the organization and the possible sources of data for visualizations in Augmented Reality and present cascaded and multi level F+C visualizations to address complex cluttered scenes that are inevitable in real environments. This article also shows filters and tools to interactively control the amount of augmentation. It compares the impact of real world context preserving to a pure virtual and uniform enhancement of these structures for augmentations of real world imagery. Finally this paper discusses the stylization of sparse object representations for AR to improve X-Ray vision." Comprehensible visualization for augmented reality.
