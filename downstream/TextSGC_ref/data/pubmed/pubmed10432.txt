This work presents a deep learning framework based on the use of deep convolutional generative adversarial networks DCGAN for infrared face image super-resolution. We use DCGAN for upscaling the images by a factor of 44 starting at a size of 1616 and obtaining a 6464 face image. Tests are conducted using different infrared face datasets operating in the near-infrared NIR and the long-wave infrared LWIR spectrum. We can see that the proposed framework performs well and preserves important details of the face. This kind of approach can be very useful in security applications where we can scan faces in the crowd or detect faces at a distance and upscale them for further recognition through an infrared or a multispectral face recognition system.
