OBJECTIVE The authors sought to construct implement and evaluate an interactive and stereoscopic resource for teaching neuroanatomy accessible from personal computers. METHODS Forty fresh brains 80 hemispheres were dissected. Images of areas of interest were captured using a manual turntable and processed and stored in a 5337-image database. Pedagogic evaluation was performed in 84 graduate medical students divided into 3 groups: 1 conventional method 2 interactive nonstereoscopic and 3 interactive and stereoscopic. The method was evaluated through a written theory test and a lab practicum. RESULTS Groups 2 and 3 showed the highest mean scores in pedagogic evaluations and differed significantly from Group 1 p < 0.05. Group 2 did not differ statistically from Group 3 p > 0.05. Size effects measured as differences in scores before and after lectures indicate the effectiveness of the method. ANOVA results showed significant difference p < 0.05 between groups and the Tukey test showed statistical differences between Group 1 and the other 2 groups p < 0.05. No statistical differences between Groups 2 and 3 were found in the practicum. However there were significant differences when Groups 2 and 3 were compared with Group 1 p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS The authors conclude that this method promoted further improvement in knowledge for students and fostered significantly higher learning when compared with traditional teaching resources.
