Functional near infrared spectroscopy NIRS is a relatively new technique complimentary to EEG for the development of brain-computer interfaces BCIs. NIRS-based systems for detecting various cognitive and affective states such as mental and emotional stress have already been demonstrated in a range of adaptive human-computer interaction HCI applications. However before NIRS-BCIs can be used reliably in realistic HCI settings substantial challenges oncerning signal processing and modeling must be addressed. Although many of those challenges have been identified previously the solutions to overcome them remain scant. In this paper we first review what can be currently done with NIRS specifically NIRS-based approaches to measuring cognitive and affective user states as well as demonstrations of passive NIRS-BCIs. We then discuss some of the primary challenges these systems would face if deployed in more realistic settings including detection latencies and motion artifacts. Lastly we investigate the effects of some of these challenges on signal reliability via a quantitative comparison of three NIRS models. The hope is that this paper will actively engage researchers to acilitate the advancement of NIRS as a more robust and useful tool to the BCI community. What we can and cannot yet do with functional near infrared spectroscopy.
