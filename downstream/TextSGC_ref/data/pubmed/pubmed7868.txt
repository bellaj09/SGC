"Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker the quintessential game of imperfect information is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44000 hands of poker DeepStack defeated with statistical significance professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas holdem. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches."
