Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS a promising noninvasive imaging technique has recently become an increasingly popular tool in resting-state brain functional connectivity FC studies. However the corresponding software packages for FC analysis are still lacking. To facilitate fNIRS-based human functional connectome studies we developed a MATLAB software package called "functional connectivity analysis tool for near-infrared spectroscopy data" FC-NIRS. This package includes the main functions of fNIRS data preprocessing quality control FC calculation and network analysis. Because this software has a friendly graphical user interface GUI FC-NIRS allows researchers to perform data analysis in an easy flexible and quick way. Furthermore FC-NIRS can accomplish batch processing during data processing and analysis thereby greatly reducing the time cost of addressing a large number of datasets. Extensive experimental results using real human brain imaging confirm the viability of the toolbox. This novel toolbox is expected to substantially facilitate fNIRS-data-based human functional connectome studies. FC-NIRS: A Functional Connectivity Analysis Tool for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Data.
