Motivated by experiments employing optogenetic stimulation of cortical regions we consider spike control strategies for ensembles of uncoupled integrate and fire neurons with a common conductance input. We construct strategies for control of spike patterns that is multineuron trains of action potentials up to some maximal spike rate determined by the neural biophysics. We emphasize a constructive role for parameter heterogeneity and find a simple rule for controllability in pairs of neurons. In particular we determine parameters for which common drive is not limited to inducing synchronous spiking. For large ensembles we determine how the number of controllable neurons varies with the number of observed recorded neurons and what collateral spiking occurs in the full ensemble during control of the subensemble. While complete control of spiking in every neuron is not possible with a single input we find that a degree of subensemble control is made possible by exploiting dynamical heterogeneity. As most available technologies for neural stimulation are underactuated in the sense that the number of target neurons far exceeds the number of independent channels of stimulation these results suggest partial control strategies that may be important in the development of sensory neuroprosthetics and other neurocontrol applications. Control strategies for underactuated neural ensembles driven by optogenetic stimulation.
