About one-third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait enhance physical fitness and prevent falls. Nonetheless the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive-physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual-task DT gait compared to exclusive physical training. Multicomponent physical exercise with simultaneous cognitive training to enhance dual-task walking of older adults: a secondary analysis of a 6-month randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up.
