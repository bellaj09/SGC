"A brain-computer interface BCI acquires brain signals extracts informative features and translates these features to commands to control an external device. This paper investigates the application of a noninvasive electroencephalography EEG-based BCI to identify brain signal features in regard to actual hand movement speed. This provides a more refined control for a BCI system in terms of movement parameters. An experiment was performed to collect EEG data from subjects while they performed right-hand movement at two different speeds namely fast and slow in four different directions. The informative features from the data were obtained using the Wavelet-Common Spatial Pattern W-CSP algorithm that provided high-temporal-spatial-spectral resolution. The applicability of these features to classify the two speeds and to reconstruct the speed profile was studied. The results for classifying speed across seven subjects yielded a mean accuracy of 83.71% using a Fisher Linear Discriminant FLD classifier. The speed components were reconstructed using multiple linear regression and significant correlation of 0.52 Pearsons linear correlation coefficient was obtained between recorded and reconstructed velocities on an average. The spatial patterns of the W-CSP features obtained showed activations in parietal and motor areas of the brain. The results achieved promises to provide a more refined control in BCI by including control of movement speed." EEG-based classification of fast and slow hand movements using Wavelet-CSP algorithm.
