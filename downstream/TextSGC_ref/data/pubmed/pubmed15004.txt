Optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA is a promising imaging modality for microvasculature studies. Meanwhile deep learning has achieved rapid development in image-to-image translation tasks. Some studies have proposed applying deep learning models to OCTA reconstruction and have obtained preliminary results. However current studies are mostly limited to a few specific deep neural networks. In this paper we conducted a comparative study to investigate OCTA reconstruction using deep learning models. Four representative network architectures including single-path models U-shaped models generative adversarial network GAN-based models and multi-path models were investigated on a dataset of OCTA images acquired from rat brains. Three potential solutions were also investigated to study the feasibility of improving performance. The results showed that U-shaped models and multi-path models are two suitable architectures for OCTA reconstruction. Furthermore merging phase information should be the potential improving direction in further research. Comparative study of deep learning models for optical coherence tomography angiography.
