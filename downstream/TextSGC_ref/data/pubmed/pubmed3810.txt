Aberrant cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuits have been implicated in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. However the neurobiological basis of OCD remains unclear. We compared patterns of functional connectivity in patients with OCD and in healthy controls using resting-state magnetoencephalography MEG. Participants comprised 24 patients with OCD 21 men 3 women and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls 19 men 3 women. Resting-state measurements were obtained over a 6-min period using a 152-channel whole-head MEG system. We examined group differences in oscillatory activity and distribution of functional cortical hubs based on the nodal centrality of phase-locking value PLV maps. Differences in resting-state functional connectivity were examined through PLV analysis in selected regions of interest based on these two findings. Patients with OCD demonstrated significantly lower delta band activity in the cortical regions of the limbic lobe insula orbitofrontal and temporal regions and theta band activity in the parietal lobe regions than healthy controls. Patients with OCD exhibited fewer functional hubs in the insula and orbitofrontal cortex and additional hubs in the cingulate and temporo-parietal regions. The OCD group exhibited significantly lower phase synchronization among the insula orbitofrontal cortex and cortical regions of the limbic lobe in all band frequencies except in the delta band. Altered functional networks in the resting state may be associated with the pathophysiology of OCD. These MEG findings indicate that OCD is associated with decreased functional connectivity in terms of phase synchrony particularly in the insula orbitofrontal cortex and cortical regions of the limbic lobe.
