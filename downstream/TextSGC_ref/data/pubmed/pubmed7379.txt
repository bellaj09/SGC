Because the prognosis of pulmonary thromboembolism PTE will be often poor early diagnosis and assessing severity at the first visit is important. A 76-year-old man with suspected venous thromboembolism and a contrast deficit in the pulmonary artery PA was revealed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography CT imaging by dual-layer spectral-detector CT IQon Spectral CT Philips Healthcare Best The Netherlands. The lung perfusion image showed decreased perfusion in the culprit lesion. The dual-energy analysis of the virtual monoenergetic imaging showed clear visualization of deep vein thrombosis DVT. In a 64-year-old man an IQon Spectral CT revealed a small contrast deficit in the PA. However no perfusion abnormality was detected in the lung perfusion analysis. The IQon Spectral CT enables the detection of lung perfusion abnormalities in addition to PTE. The IQon Spectral CT imaging may be useful for the "one-stop shop" evaluation of PTE and DVT. <Learning objective: The prognosis of pulmonary thromboembolism PTE will be often poor so early diagnosis and assessing severity at the first visit is important. The dual-layer spectral-detector computed tomography imaging for PTE whereby the iodine map provided information regarding lung perfusion whereas virtual monoenergetic images enabled clear visualization of deep vein thrombosis.>. Novel assessment of retrospective on-demand analysis of venous thromboembolism by dual-layer spectral-detector CT.
