Deep learning-based image segmentation is by now firmly established as a robust tool in image segmentation. It has been widely used to separate homogeneous areas as the first and critical component of diagnosis and treatment pipeline. In this article we present a critical appraisal of popular methods that have employed deep-learning techniques for medical image segmentation. Moreover we summarize the most common challenges incurred and suggest possible solutions. Deep Learning Techniques for Medical Image Segmentation: Achievements and Challenges.
