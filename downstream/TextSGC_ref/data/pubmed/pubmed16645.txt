Virtual reality exposure therapy VRET is an altered form of behavioral therapy and may be a possible alternative to standard in vivo exposure. Virtual reality integrates real-time computer graphics body tracking devices visual displays and other sensory input devices to immerse patients in a computer-generated virtual environment. Research on this type of treatment for anxiety disorders is discussed in this article and the mediating and moderating variables that influence VR treatment effectiveness as well. Evidence is found that VRET is effective for participants with fear of heights and of flying. For other phobias research to date is not conclusive. More randomized clinical trials in which VRET is compared with standard exposure are required. Furthermore studies are needed in which VRET is not just a component of the treatment package evaluated but in which VRET should be assessed as a stand-alone treatment.
