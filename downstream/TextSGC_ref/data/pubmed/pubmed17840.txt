"In view of the urgent need for intelligent rehabilitation equipment for some disabled people an intelligent upper limb rehabilitation training robot is designed by applying the theories of artificial intelligence information control human-machine engineering and more. A new robot structure is proposed that combines the use of a flexible rope with an exoskeleton. By introducing environmentally intelligent ergonomics combined with virtual reality multi-channel information fusion interaction technology and big-data analysis a collaborative efficient and intelligent remote rehabilitation system based on a humans natural response and other related big-data information is constructed. For the multi-degree of the freedom robot system optimal adaptive robust control design is introduced based on Udwdia-Kalaba theory and fuzzy set theory. The new equipment will help doctors and medical institutions to optimize both rehabilitation programs and their management so that patients are more comfortable safer and more active in their rehabilitation training in order to obtain better rehabilitation results."
