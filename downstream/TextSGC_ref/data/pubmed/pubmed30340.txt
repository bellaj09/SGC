In vivo studies have suggested that motor exercise can improve muscle regeneration after injury. Nevertheless preclinical investigations still lack reliable tools to monitor motor performance over time and to deliver optimal training protocols to maximize force recovery. Here we evaluated the utility of a murine robotic platform i to detect early impairment and longitudinal recovery after acute skeletal muscle injury and ii to administer varying intensity training protocols to enhance forelimb motor performance. A Murine Model of Robotic Training to Evaluate Skeletal Muscle Recovery after Injury.
