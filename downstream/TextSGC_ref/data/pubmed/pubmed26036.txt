For application in a Virtual Reality VR based laparoscopic surgery simulator computationally efficient algorithms for the description of the mechanical behavior of soft tissue have been developed. The explicit Finite Element Method has turned out to be a robust method for this purpose provided that absolute strain formulations are applied. Furthermore a VR model of a uterus and its adnexe has been generated and simulation results are presented. Mechanical modeling of soft biological tissues for application in virtual reality based laparoscopy simulators.
