"Recently the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy addressed the resect and discard strategy determining that accurate in vivo differentiation of colorectal polyps CP is necessary. Previous studies have suggested a promising application of artificial intelligence AI using deep learning in object recognition. Therefore we aimed to construct an AI system that can accurately detect and classify CP using stored still images during colonoscopy." Automated endoscopic detection and classification of colorectal polyps using convolutional neural networks.
