A 50-year-old man developed acute sub-massive pulmonary thromboembolism and proximal deep venous thrombosis. A continuous intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin UFH was started and an inferior vena cava IVC filter was implanted. He developed symptomatic complete obstruction of the filter 6 days after the initiation of UFH and he was transferred to our hospital. We started pulse-spray catheter-directed thrombolysis CDT with urokinase. However thrombocytopenia occurred 11 days after the initiation of heparin. We suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia HIT with thrombosis HITT and switched from UFH to argatroban. In addition we continued pulse-spray CDT. As a result thrombocytopenia improved and thrombolysis was successful without complications of recurrent thromboembolism or bleeding leading to retrieval of the IVC filter. The antigen assay for HIT was strongly positive supporting our diagnosis. In patients with suspected HIT it is important to switch from heparin to an alternative anticoagulant as soon as possible and pulse-spray CDT with urokinase and argatroban as anticoagulant therapy may be effective treatment for thrombo-occlusions of IVC filters in patients with HITT. <Learning objective: Thrombo-occlusion is a serious complication of inferior vena cava filters. Anticoagulant therapy alone is not effective for dissolving thrombo-occlusions of inferior vena cava filters. In patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis pulse-spray catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase and argatroban as anticoagulant therapy may be effective treatment for venous thrombo-occlusion.>. Pulse-spray catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase and argatroban for thrombo-occlusion of an inferior vena cava filter due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis.
