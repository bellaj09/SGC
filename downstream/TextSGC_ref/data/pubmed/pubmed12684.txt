In the radiofrequency RF range the electrical properties of tissues EPs: conductivity and permittivity are modulated by the ionic and water content which change for pathological conditions. Information on tissues EPs can be used e.g. in oncology as a biomarker. The inability of MR-Electrical Properties Tomography techniques MR-EPT to accurately reconstruct tissue EPs by relating MR measurements of the transmit RF field to the EPs limits their clinical applicability. Instead of employing electromagnetic models posing strict requirements on the measured MRI quantities we propose a data driven approach where the electrical properties reconstruction problem can be casted as a supervised deep learning task DL-EPT. DL-EPT reconstructions for simulations and MR measurements at 3 Tesla on phantoms and human brains using a conditional generative adversarial network demonstrate high quality EPs reconstructions and greatly improved precision compared to conventional MR-EPT. The supervised learning approach leverages the strength of electromagnetic simulations allowing circumvention of inaccessible MR electromagnetic quantities. Since DL-EPT is more noise-robust than MR-EPT the requirements for MR acquisitions can be relaxed. This could be\xa0a major step forward to turn electrical properties tomography into a reliable biomarker where pathological conditions can be revealed and characterized by abnormalities in tissue electrical properties.
