Although the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD in the general and military population seem very similar combat-related PTSD cr-PTSD is typically thought to be more severe due to the repeated and prolonged exposure of traumatic events. Therapeutic adherence is reported a problem in military populations compromising treatment efficacy. Therefore a new potential supplementary treatment is specially designed for patients with cr-PTSD. This intervention is called Military Motion Memory Desensitization and Reprocessing 3MDR. The treatment incorporates key elements of successful treatments as Virtual Reality Exposure VRE and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing EMDR and adds motion to the condition. We aimed at designing a treatment procedure that preserved dual task processing principle yet introduced new engagement by performing the desensitization during motion by to walking on a treadmill. Moreover we aimed at exposure to real high-affect pictures of deployment setting. Subjects walk a repetitive cycle while walking and viewing high affect pictures of deployment scenes. Dual task processing was maintained by an oscillating ball. Aspects of presence are adhered to to maximize possible positive outcome. The effect of military motion-assisted memory desensitization and reprocessing treatment on the symptoms of combat-related post traumatic stress disorder: first preliminary results.
