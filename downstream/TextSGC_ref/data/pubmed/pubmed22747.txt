Neuroprosthetic devices based on brain-machine interface technology hold promise for the restoration of body mobility in patients suffering from devastating motor deficits caused by brain injury neurologic diseases and limb loss. During the last decade considerable progress has been achieved in this multidisciplinary research mainly in the brain-machine interface that enacts upper-limb functionality. However a considerable number of problems need to be resolved before fully functional limb neuroprostheses can be built. To move towards developing neuroprosthetic devices for humans brain-machine interface research has to address a number of issues related to improving the quality of neuronal recordings achieving stable long-term performance and extending the brain-machine interface approach to a broad range of motor and sensory functions. Here we review the future steps that are part of the strategic plan of the Duke University Center for Neuroengineering and its partners the Brazilian National Institute of Brain-Machine Interfaces and the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne EPFL Center for Neuroprosthetics to bring this new technology to clinical fruition. Future developments in brain-machine interface research.
