With the identification of literature shortfalls on the techniques employed in intraoperative navigated ION spinal surgery we outline a number of measures which have been synthesised into a coherent operative technique. These include positioning dissection management of the reference frame the grip the angle of attack the drill the template the pedicle screw the wire and navigated intrathecal analgesia. Optimizing techniques to improve accuracy allow an overall reduction of the repetition of the surgical steps with its associated productivity benefits including time cost radiation and safety.
