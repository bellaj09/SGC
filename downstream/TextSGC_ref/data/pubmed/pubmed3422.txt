Neuropeptides function in animals to modulate most if not all complex behaviors. In invertebrates neuropeptides can function as the primary neurotransmitter of a neuron but more generally they co-localize with a small molecule neurotransmitter as is commonly seen in vertebrates. Because a single neuron can express multiple neuropeptides and because neuropeptides can bind to multiple G protein-coupled receptors neuropeptide actions increase the complexity by which the neural connectome can be activated or inhibited. Humans are estimated to have 90 plus neuropeptide genes; by contrast nematodes a relatively simple organism have a slightly larger complement of neuropeptide genes. For instance the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has over 100 neuropeptide-encoding genes of which at least 31 genes encode peptides of the FMRFamide family. To understand the function of this large FMRFamide peptide family we isolated knockouts of different FMRFamide-encoding genes and generated transgenic animals in which the peptides are overexpressed. We assayed these animals on two basic behaviors: locomotion and reproduction. Modulating levels of different neuropeptides have strong as well as subtle effects on these behaviors. These data suggest that neuropeptides play critical roles in C. elegans to fine tune neural circuits controlling locomotion and reproduction.
