"EEG-based brain-computer interface BCI technology creates non-biological pathways for conveying a users mental intent solely through noninvasively measured neural signals. While optimizing the performance of a single task has long been the focus of BCI research in order to translate this technology into everyday life realistic situations in which multiple tasks are performed simultaneously must be investigated. In this paper we explore the concept of cognitive flexibility or multitasking within the BCI framework by utilizing a 2-D cursor control task using sensorimotor rhythms SMRs and a four-target visual attention task using steady-state visual evoked potentials SSVEPs both individually and simultaneously. We found no significant difference between the accuracy of the tasks when executing them alone SMR-57.9%  15.4% and SSVEP-59.0%  14.2% and simultaneously SMR-54.9%  17.2% and SSVEP-57.5%  15.4%. These modest decreases in performance were supported by similar non-significant changes in the electrophysiology of the SSVEP and SMR signals. In this sense we report that multiple BCI tasks can be performed simultaneously without a significant deterioration in performance; this finding will help drive these systems toward realistic daily use in which a users cognition will need to be involved in multiple tasks at once."
