Translational studies on motor control and neurological disorders require detailed monitoring of sensorimotor components of natural limb movements in relevant animal models. However available experimental tools do not provide a sufficiently rich repertoire of behavioral signals. Here we developed a robotic platform that enables the monitoring of kinematics interaction forces and neurophysiological signals during user-defined upper limb tasks for monkeys. A versatile robotic platform for the design of natural three-dimensional reaching and grasping tasks in monkeys.
