Error processing is a critical component of cognitive control an executive function that has been widely implicated in substance misuse. In previous studies we showed that error related activations of the thalamus predicted relapse to drug use in cocaine addicted individuals Luo et al. 2013. Here we investigated whether the error-related functional connectivity of the thalamus is altered in cocaine dependent patients PCD n\xa0=\xa054 as compared to demographically matched healthy individuals HC n\xa0=\xa054. The results of a generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis showed negative thalamic connectivity with the ventral medial prefrontal cortex vmPFC in the area of perigenual and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in HC but not PCD p\xa0<\xa00.05 corrected two-sample t test. This difference in functional connectivity was not observed for task-residual signals suggesting that it is specific to task-related processes during cognitive control. Further the thalamic-vmPFC connectivity is positively correlated with the amount of cocaine use in the prior month for female but not for male PCD. These findings add to recent literature and provide additional evidence for circuit-level biomarkers of cocaine dependence. Error-related functional connectivity of the thalamus in cocaine dependence.
