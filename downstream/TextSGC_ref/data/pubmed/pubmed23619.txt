We present the architecture and usability evaluation of virtual reality system-"Positive Bike"-designed for improving cognitive and motor conditions in frail elderly patients. The system consists of a cycle-ergometer integrated in an immersive virtual reality system CAVE which allows combining motor and cognitive exercises according to a "dual-task" paradigm. We tested the usability and user\s experience of the prototype in a pilot evaluation study that involved five elderly patients. The prototype was tested in one-session training to understand the limitations and areas for improvement of our system. The evaluation consisted in i usability assessment using the system usability scale; ii evaluation of user\s engagement using the flow state scale; and iii expert evaluation involving interviews with domain experts. Results showed a good usability both for system usability scale and the semi-structured interview. The level of flow i.e. enjoyment with the task at hand measured using the short flow state scale was also high. Analysis of semi-structured interview carried out with domain experts provided further indications to improve the system. Overall these findings show that despite some limitations the system is usable and provides an enjoyable user\s experience. Characteristics Usability and Users Experience of a System Combining Cognitive and Physical Therapy in a Virtual Environment: Positive Bike.
