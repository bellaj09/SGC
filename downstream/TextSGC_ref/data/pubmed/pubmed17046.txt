We examined the impact of social feedback and objective false evidence on belief in occurrence belief in accuracy and recollection of an autobiographical experience. Participants viewed six virtual scenes e.g. park and were tested on their belief/recollection. After 1-week participants were randomly assigned to four groups. One group received social feedback that one scene was not experienced. A second group received objective false evidence that one of the scenes was not shown. A third group received both social feedback and objective false evidence and the control group did not receive any manipulation. Belief in occurrence dropped considerably in the social feedback group and in the combined group. Also nonbelieved memories were most likely to occur in participants receiving both social feedback and objective false evidence. We show that social feedback and objective false evidence undermine belief in occurrence but that they leave belief in accuracy and recollection unaffected. Believing does not equal remembering: The effects of social feedback and objective false evidence on belief in occurrence belief in accuracy and recollection.
