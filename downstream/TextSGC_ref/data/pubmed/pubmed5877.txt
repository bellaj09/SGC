"Deep brain stimulation DBS of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinsons disease is known to cause a subtle but important adverse impact on behaviour with impulsivity its most widely reported manifestation. However precisely which computational components of the decision process are modulated is not fully understood. Here we probe a number of distinct subprocesses including temporal discount outcome utility instrumental learning rate instrumental outcome sensitivity reward-loss trade-offs and perseveration. We tested 22 Parkinsons Disease patients both on and off subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation STN-DBS while they performed an instrumental learning task involving financial rewards and losses and an inter-temporal choice task for financial rewards. We found that instrumental learning performance was significantly worse following stimulation due to modulation of instrumental outcome sensitivity. Specifically patients became less sensitive to decision values for both rewards and losses but without any change to the learning rate or reward-loss trade-offs. However we found no evidence that DBS modulated different components of temporal impulsivity. In conclusion our results implicate the subthalamic nucleus in a modulation of outcome value in experience-based learning and decision-making in Parkinsons disease suggesting a more pervasive role of the subthalamic nucleus in the control of human decision-making than previously thought."
