The posterior cingulate cortex PCC Brodmann areas 23/31 is one of the least well-understood regions of the cortex. The PCC has very high levels of metabolic consumption and network analyses of functional and structural data suggest it is a core hub in the human connectome; however contemporary neuroscience lacks a clear account of its functional significance. Consequently many studies over the last decade have focused on understanding the role this region plays in cognition particularly given its apparent tendency to deactivate during demanding external tasks. Consistent with the cytoarchitecture recent work leveraging complex analytical approaches highlight that the connections the PCC forms with other regions are heterogeneous going beyond a single network while recent studies of its function highlight a role in a wide range of complex forms of cognition including memory navigation and narrative comprehension. This constellation of observations highlights a role for PCC in a set of cognitive processes that are supported by internal representations but may lack a common type of representational content. Together these structural and functional studies contribute to an emerging view of the PCC as contributing to how cognition unfolds rather than what it is focused on.
