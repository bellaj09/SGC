Time-frequency T-F masks represent powerful tools to increase the intelligibility of speech in background noise. Translational relevance is provided by their accurate estimation based only on the signal-plus-noise mixture using deep learning or other machine-learning techniques. In the current study a technique is designed to capture the benefits of existing techniques. In the ideal quantized mask IQM speech and noise are partitioned into T-F units and each unit receives one of N attenuations according to its signal-to-noise ratio. It was found that as few as four to eight attenuation steps IQM4 IQM8 improved intelligibility over the ideal binary mask IBM having two attenuation steps and equaled the intelligibility resulting from the ideal ratio mask IRM having a theoretically infinite number of steps. Sound-quality ratings and rankings of noisy speech processed by the IQM4 and IQM8 were also superior to that processed by the IBM and equaled or exceeded that processed by the IRM. It is concluded that the intelligibility and sound-quality advantages of infinite attenuation resolution can be captured by an IQM having only a very small number of steps. Further the classification-based nature of the IQM might provide algorithmic advantages over the regression-based IRM during machine estimation.
