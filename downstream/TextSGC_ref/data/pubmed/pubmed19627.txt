High energy trauma is rare and as a result training of prehospital care providers often takes place during the real situation with the patient as the object for the learning process. Such training could instead be carried out in the context of simulation out of danger for both patients and personnel. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the development and foci of research on simulation in prehospital care practice. Mapping the use of simulation in prehospital care - a literature review.
