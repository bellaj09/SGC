Human facial expressions are a complex capacity carrying important psychological and neurological information. Facial expressions typically involve the co-activation of several muscles; they vary between individuals between voluntary versus spontaneous expressions and depend strongly on personal interpretation. Accordingly while high-resolution recording of muscle activation in a non-laboratory setting offers exciting opportunities it remains a major challenge. This paper describes a wearable and non-invasive method for objective mapping of facial muscle activation and demonstrates its application in a natural setting. We focus on muscle activation associated with "enjoyment" "social" and "masked" smiles; three categories with distinct social meanings. We use an innovative dry soft electrode array designed specifically for facial surface electromyography recording a customized independent component analysis algorithm and a short training procedure to achieve the desired mapping. First identification of the orbicularis oculi and the levator labii superioris was demonstrated from voluntary expressions. Second the zygomaticus major was identified from voluntary and spontaneous Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles. Finally using a wireless device in an unmodified work environment revealed expressions of diverse emotions in face-to-face interaction. Our high-resolution and crosstalk-free mapping along with excellent user-convenience opens new opportunities in gaming virtual-reality bio-feedback and objective psychological and neurological assessment.
