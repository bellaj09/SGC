The O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase MGMT promoter methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 IDH1 mutation in high-grade gliomas HGG have proven to be the two important molecular indicators associated with better prognosis. Traditionally the statuses of MGMT and IDH1 are obtained via surgical biopsy which has limited their wider clinical implementation. Accurate presurgical prediction of their statuses based on preoperative multimodal neuroimaging is of great clinical value for a better treatment plan. Currently the available data set associated with this study has several challenges such as small sample size and complex nonlinear image feature-to-molecular label relationship. To address these issues we propose a novel multi-label nonlinear matrix completion MNMC model to jointly predict both MGMT and IDH1 statuses in a multi-task framework. Specifically we first employ a nonlinear random Fourier feature mapping to improve the linear separability of the data and then use transductive multi-task feature selection performed in a nonlinearly transformed feature space to refine the imputed soft labels thus alleviating the overfitting problem caused by small sample size. We further design an optimization algorithm with a guaranteed convergence ability based on a block prox-linear method to solve the proposed MNMC model. Finally by using a single-center multimodal brain imaging and molecular pathology data set of HGG we derive brain functional and structural connectomics features to jointly predict MGMT and IDH1 statuses. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previously widely used single- and multi-task machine learning methods. This paper also shows the promise of utilizing brain connectomics for HGG prognosis in a non-invasive manner.
