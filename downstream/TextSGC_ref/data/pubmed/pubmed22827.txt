Access to the laboratory component of a class is limited by resources while lab training is not currently possible for distance learning. To overcome the problem a solution is proposed to enable hands-on interactive objectively scored and appropriately mentored learning in a widely accessible environment. The proposed solution is the Virtual-Reality Motor-Skills trainer to teach basic fine-motor skills using Haptics for touch and feel interaction as well as a 3D virtual reality environment for visualization. A surgical and fine-motor skills trainer for everyone? Touch and force-feedback in a virtual reality environment for surgical training.
