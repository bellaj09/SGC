Wireless capsule endoscopy WCE has developed rapidly over the last several years and now enables physicians to examine the gastrointestinal tract without surgical operation. However a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a diagnosis. Deep convolutional neural networks CNNs have demonstrated impressive performance in different computer vision tasks. Thus in this work we aim to explore the feasibility of deep learning for ulcer recognition and optimize a CNN-based ulcer recognition architecture for WCE images. By analyzing the ulcer recognition task and characteristics of classic deep learning networks we propose a HAnet architecture that uses ResNet-34 as the base network and fuses hyper features from the shallow layer with deep features in deeper layers to provide final diagnostic decisions. 1416 independent WCE videos are collected for this study. The overall test accuracy of our HAnet is 92.05% and its sensitivity and specificity are 91.64% and 92.42% respectively. According to our comparisons of F1 F2 and ROC-AUC the proposed method performs better than several off-the-shelf CNN models including VGG DenseNet and Inception-ResNet-v2 and classical machine learning methods with handcrafted features for WCE image classification. Overall this study demonstrates that recognizing ulcers in WCE images via the deep CNN method is feasible and could help reduce the tedious image reading work of physicians. Moreover our HAnet architecture tailored for this problem gives a fine choice for the design of network structure.
