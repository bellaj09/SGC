Feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalogram MI-EEG has shown good application prospects in the field of medical health. Also multivariate entropy-based feature extraction methods have been gradually applied to analyze complex multichannel biomedical signals such as EEG and electromyography. Compared with traditional multivariate entropies refined composite multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy RCmvMFE overcomes the defect of unstable entropy values caused by the scale factor increase and is beneficial towards obtaining richer feature information. However the coarse-grained process of RCmvMFE is mean filtered which weakens Gaussian noise and is powerless against random impulse noise interference. This yields poor quality feature information and low accuracy classification. In this paper RCmvMFE is improved IRCmvMFE by using composite filters in the coarse-grained procedure to enhance filter performance. Median filters are employed to remove the impulse noise interference from multichannel MI-EEG signals and these filtered MI-EEGs are further smoothed by the mean filters. The multiscale IRCmvMFEs are calculated for all channels of composite filtered MI-EEGs forming a feature vector and a support vector machine is used for pattern classification. Based on two public datasets with different motor imagery tasks the recognition results of 10\u2009\u200910-fold cross-validation achieved 99.43% and 99.86% respectively and the statistical analysis of experimental results was completed showing the effectiveness of IRCmvMFE as well. The proposed IRCmvMFE-based feature extraction method is superior compared to entropy-based and traditional methods.
