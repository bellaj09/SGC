Objective. To determine the indicators of quality for application activities in pharmacy team-based learning TBL. Methods. A modified Delphi process was conducted with pharmacy TBL experts. Twenty-three experts met the inclusion criteria including having at least four years of TBL experience designing at least eight TBL sessions training others to use TBL and authoring a peer-reviewed TBL pharmacy paper. In round 1 panelists responded to five open-ended questions about their successful TBL applications activities including satisfaction with the activity and methods for creating positive student outcomes. In round 2 panelists indicated their level of agreement with the round 1 quality indicators using a four-point Likert rating. Consensus was set at 80% strongly agree/agree. In an open comment period panelists provided suggestions to help expand the indicator descriptions. Indicators were verified based on TBL and the education literature. Results. Twenty panelists 87% of those eligible responded in round 1 and 17 85% participation in round 2. Sixteen quality indicators were identified in round 1 with 14 achieving consensus in round 2. "Uses authentic pharmacy challenges or situations" 88% strongly agree/agree and "incorporates or provides effective feedback to groups" 88% strongly agree/agree met consensus. However "has multiple right answers" 76% strongly agree/agree and "incorporates elements from school specific emphases eg faith underserved" 53% strongly agree/agree did not reach consensus. Conclusions. These indicators can assist faculty members in designing application activities to provide high-quality TBL exercises that promote deep thinking and engaged classroom discussion. The indicators could also guide faculty development and quality improvement efforts such as peer review of application activities.
