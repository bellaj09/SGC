Automatic approach for bladder segmentation from computed tomography CT images is highly desirable in clinical practice. It is a challenging task since the bladder usually suffers large variations of appearance and low soft-tissue contrast in CT images. In this study we present a deep learning-based approach which involves a convolutional neural network CNN and a 3D fully connected conditional random fields recurrent neural network CRF-RNN to perform accurate bladder segmentation. We also propose a novel preprocessing method called dual-channel preprocessing to further advance the segmentation performance of our approach.
