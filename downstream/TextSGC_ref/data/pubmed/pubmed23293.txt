"The pain of a severe burn injury is often characterised by intense background pain coupled with severe exacerbations associated with essential procedures such as dressing changes. The experience of pain is affected by patients psychological state and can be enhanced by the anxiety fear and distress caused by environmental and visual inputs. Virtual Reality VR distraction has been used with success in areas such as burns paediatrics and oncology. The underlying principle of VR is that attention is diverted from the painful stimulus by the use of engaging dynamic 3D visual content and associated auditory stimuli. Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies undertaken during VR distraction from experimental pain have demonstrated enhancement of the descending cortical pain-control system."
