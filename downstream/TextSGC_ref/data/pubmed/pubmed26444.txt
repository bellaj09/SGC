Advancements in digital signal processing DSP and machine learning techniques have boosted the popularity of brain-computer interfaces BCIs where electroencephalography is a widely accepted method to enable intuitive human-machine interaction. Nevertheless the evolution of such interfaces is currently hampered by the unavailability of embedded platforms capable of delivering the required computational power at high energy efficiency and allowing for a small and unobtrusive form factor. To fill this gap we developed BioWolf a highly wearable 40\xa0mm\xa0 20 mm  2 mm BCI platform based on Mr. Wolf a parallel ultra low power system-on-chip featuring nine RISC-V cores with DSP-oriented instruction set extensions. BioWolf also integrates a commercial 8-channel medical-grade analog-to-digital converter and an ARM-Cortex M4 microcontroller unit MCU with bluetooth low-energy connectivity. To demonstrate the capabilities of the system we implemented and tested a BCI featuring canonical correlation analysis CCA of steady-state visual evoked potentials. The system achieves an average information transfer rate of 1.46 b/s aligned with the state-of-the-art of bench-top systems. Thanks to the reduced power envelope of the digital computational platform which consumes less than the analog front-end the total power budget is just 6.31\xa0mW providing up to 38\xa0h operation 65\xa0mAh battery. To our knowledge our design is the first to explore the significant energy boost of a parallel MCU with respect to single-core MCUs for CCA-based BCI.
