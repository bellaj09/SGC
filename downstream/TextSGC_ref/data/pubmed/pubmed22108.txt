"In clinical practice therapists often encounter cases of unilateral spatial neglect USN observed in far and near space. In this case report immersive virtual reality VR technology was adopted as a therapy tool in a patient with stroke with severe near and far space neglect. Neuropsychological tests in near and far space as well as the Catherine Bergego Scale CBS as an index of neglect in daily living were measured preintervention and postintervention. Improvement of neuropsychological tests particularly in far space was clearly demonstrated postintervention. However CBS score did not change postintervention. This may be because the patient unsuccessfully translated these visual search task skills used in far space to activities of daily living. Our findings suggest the potential use of immersive VR technology in patients with USN and highlight the VR programmes limited ability to fully recover a patients disability in natural settings." Differing effects of an immersive virtual reality programme on unilateral spatial neglect on activities of daily living.
