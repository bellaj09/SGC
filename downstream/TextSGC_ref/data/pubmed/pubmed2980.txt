"Corpus callosum dysgenesis CCD describes a collection of brain malformations in which the main fiber tract connecting the two hemispheres is either absent complete CCD or agenesis of the corpus callosum or reduced in size partial CCD. Humans with these neurodevelopmental disorders have a wide range of cognitive outcomes including seemingly preserved features of interhemispheric communication in some cases. However the structural substrates that could underlie this variability in outcome remain to be fully elucidated. Here for the first time we characterize the global brain connectivity of a mouse model of complete and partial CCD. We demonstrate features of structural brain connectivity that model those predicted in humans with CCD including Probst bundles in complete CCD and heterotopic sigmoidal connections in partial CCD. Crucially we also histologically validate the recently predicted ectopic sigmoid bundle present in humans with partial CCD validating the utility of this mouse model for fine anatomical studies of this disorder. Taken together this work describes a mouse model of altered structural connectivity in variable severity CCD and forms a foundation for future studies investigating the function and mechanisms of development of plastic tracts in developmental disorders of brain connectivity."
