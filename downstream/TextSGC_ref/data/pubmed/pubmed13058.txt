In the last decade increasing attention has been paid to the study of gene fusions. However the problem of determining whether a gene fusion is a cancer driver or just a passenger mutation is still an open issue. Here we present DEEPrior an inherently flexible deep learning tool with two modes Inference and Retraining. Inference mode predicts the probability of a gene fusion being involved in an oncogenic process by directly exploiting the amino acid sequence of the fused protein. Retraining mode allows to obtain a custom prediction model including new data provided by the user. DEEPrior: a deep learning tool for the prioritization of gene fusions.
