Various ophthalmic procedures critically depend on high-quality images. For instance efficiency of teleophthalmology a framework to bring advanced eye care to remote regions is determined by the capability of assessing diagnostic quality of ocular fundus photographs FPs and rejecting poor-quality ones at the source. In this context we study algorithmic methods of classifying high- and low-quality FPs. Crucially diagnostic quality DQ - determined by clinically but not necessarily perceptually significant structures - is not synonymous with perceptual appeal. Yet traditional methods handpick features individually or in small subsets to meet certain ad hoc perceptual requirements. In contrast we investigate the efficacy of a comprehensive set of structure-preserving features systematically generated by a deep scattering network ScatNet. Specifically we consider three advanced machine learning classifiers train each using ScatNet as well as traditional features separately and demonstrate that the former ensure significantly superior performance for each classifier under multiple criteria including classification accuracy.
