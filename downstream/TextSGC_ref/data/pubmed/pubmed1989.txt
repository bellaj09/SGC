Alternative splicing AS allows a single gene to generate multiple protein isoforms. It has been hypothesized that AS plays a role in brain wiring by increasing the number of cell recognition molecules necessary for forming connections between neurons. Many studies have characterized isoform expression patterns of various genes in the brain but very few have addressed whether specific isoforms play a functional role in neuronal wiring. In our recent work we reported the cell-type-specific AS of the cell recognition molecule Dscam2. Exclusive expression of Dscam2 isoforms allows tightly associated neurons to signal repulsion selectively within the same cell-types without interfering with one another. We show that preventing cell-specific isoform expression in 2 closely associated neurons disrupts their axon terminal morphology. We propose that the requirement for isoform specificity extends to synapses and discuss experiments that can test this directly. Factors that regulate Dscam2 cell-type-specific AS likely regulate the splicing of many genes involved in neurodevelopment. These regulators of alternative splicing may act broadly to control many genes involved in the development of specific neuron types. Identifying these factors is a key step in understanding how AS contributes to the brain connectome.
