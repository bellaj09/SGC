The goal of this longitudinal study was to test an innovative approach to smoking cessation that might be particularly attractive to adolescent smokers. The study was a participatory research effort between academic and school partners. The intervention used an Internet-based virtual reality world combined with motivational interviewing conducted in real-time by a smoking cessation counselor. Participants were 136 adolescent smokers recruited from high schools randomized to the intervention or a measurement-only control condition. Those who participated in the program were significantly more likely than controls to report at the immediate post-intervention assessment that they had abstained from smoking during the past week p<or=.01 smoked fewer days in the past week p<or=.001 smoked fewer cigarettes in the past week p<or=.01 and considered themselves a former smoke p<or=.05. Only the number of times quit was statistically significant at a one-year follow-up assessment p<or=.05. The lack of longer-term results is discussed as are methodological challenges in conducting a cluster-randomized smoking cessation study.
