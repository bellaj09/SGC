"Previous research showed that full body ownership illusions in virtual reality VR can be robustly induced by providing congruent visual stimulation and that congruent tactile experiences provide a dispensable extension to an already established phenomenon. Here we show that visuo-tactile congruency indeed does not add to already high measures for body ownership on explicit measures but does modulate movement behavior when walking in the laboratory. Specifically participants who took ownership over a more corpulent virtual body with intact visuo-tactile congruency increased safety distances towards the laboratorys walls compared to participants who experienced the same illusion with deteriorated visuo-tactile congruency. This effect is in line with the body schema more readily adapting to a more corpulent body after receiving congruent tactile information. We conclude that the action-oriented unconscious body schema relies more heavily on tactile information compared to more explicit aspects of body ownership." Visuo-tactile congruency influences the body schema during full body ownership illusion.
