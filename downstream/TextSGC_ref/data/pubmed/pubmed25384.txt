Non invasive brain-computer interfaces BCI allow people to communicate by modulating features of their electroencephalogram EEG. Spatiotemporal filtering has a vital role in multi-class EEG based BCI. In this study we used a novel combination of principle component analysis independent component analysis and dipole source localization to design a spatiotemporal multiple source tuning SPAMSORT filter bank each channel of which was tuned to the activity of an underlying dipole source. Changes in the event-related spectral perturbation ERSP were measured and used to train a linear support vector machine to classify between four classes of motor imagery tasks left hand right hand foot and tongue for one subject. ERSP values were significantly p<0.01 different across tasks and better p<0.01 than conventional spatial filtering methods large Laplacian and common average reference. Classification resulted in an average accuracy of 82.5%. This approach could lead to promising BCI applications such as control of a prosthesis with multiple degrees of freedom.
