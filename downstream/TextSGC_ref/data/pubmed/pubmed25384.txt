There is little evidence considering the relationship between movement-specific reinvestment a dimension of personality which refers to the propensity for individuals to consciously monitor and control their movements and working memory during motor skill performance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS measuring oxyhemoglobin demands in the frontal cortex during performance of virtual reality VR psychomotor tasks can be used to examine this research gap.
