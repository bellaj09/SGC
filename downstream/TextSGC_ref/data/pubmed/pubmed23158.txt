"Medical imaging has been one of the most revolutionary innovations in medicine. Today as health care professionals shift their focus toward more sophisticated technology and minimally invasive procedures interventional radiology IR has become a rapidly expanding specialty. Despite these advances there is a lack of doctors specializing in this field. A growing body of evidence suggests that the low number of applicants for posts may be due to poor exposure to the specialty at medical school. In this article we outline the importance of IR in todays health care system. Next we evaluate the evidence that there is a lack of knowledge of IR not only among medical students in the UK but globally. We further discuss how a more effective incorporation of IR in the undergraduate curriculum can enhance medical students interest in the field and subsequently increase the number of doctors specializing in IR. Finally we suggest alternative strategies to gauge medical students interest in IR including teaching via e-learning and virtual reality." Should there be greater exposure to interventional radiology in the undergraduate curriculum?
