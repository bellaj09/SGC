"Recent clinical and preclinical studies have suggested that deep brain stimulation DBS can be used as a tool to enhance cognitive functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of DBS at three separate targets in the Papez circuit including the anterior nucleus of thalamus ANT the entorhinal cortex EC and the fornix FX on cognitive behaviors in an Alzheimers disease AD rat model."
