"According to diagnostic criteria skin tumors can be divided into three categories: benign low degree and high degree malignancy. For high degree malignant skin tumors if not detected in time they can do serious harm to patients health. However in clinical practice identifying malignant degree requires biopsy and pathological examination which is time costly. Furthermore in many areas due to the severe shortage of dermatologists its inconvenient for patients to go to hospital for examination. Therefore an easy to access screening method of malignant skin tumors is needed urgently. Firstly we spend 5\xa0years to build a dataset which includes 4500 images of 10 kinds of skin tumors. All instances are verified pathologically thus trustworthy; Secondly we label each instance to be either low-risk high-risk or dangerous in which Junctional nevus Intradermal nevus Dermatofibroma Lipoma and Seborrheic keratosis are low-risk Basal cell carcinoma Bowens disease and Actinic keratosis are high-risk Squamous cell carcinoma and Malignant melanoma are dangerous; Thirdly we apply the Xception architecture to build the risk degree classifier. The area under the curve AUC for three risk degrees reach 0.959 0.919 and 0.947 respectively. To further evaluate the validity of the proposed risk degree classifier we conduct a competition with 20 professional dermatologists. The results showed the proposed classifier outperforms dermatologists. Our system is helpful to patients in preliminary screening. It can identify the patients who are at risk and alert them to go to hospital for further examination."
