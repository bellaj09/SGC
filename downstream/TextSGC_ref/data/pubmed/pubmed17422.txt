Since Head Mounted Displays HMD datagloves tracking systems and powerful computer graphics resources are nowadays in an affordable price range the usage of PC-based "Virtual Training Systems" becomes very attractive. However due to the limited field of view of HMD devices additional modalities have to be provided to benefit from 3D environments. A 3D sound simulation can improve the capabilities of VR systems dramatically. Unfortunately realistic 3D sound simulations are expensive and demand a tremendous amount of computational power to calculate reverberation occlusion and obstruction effects. To use 3D sound in a PC-based training system as a way to direct and guide trainees to observe specific events in 3D space a cheaper alternative has to be provided so that a broader range of applications can take advantage of this modality. To address this issue we focus in this paper on the evaluation of a low-cost 3D sound simulation that is capable of providing traceable 3D sound events. We describe our experimental system setup using conventional stereo headsets in combination with a tracked HMD device and present our results with regard to precision speed and used signal types for localizing simulated sound events in a virtual training environment. Evaluation of a low-cost 3D sound system for immersive virtual reality training systems.
