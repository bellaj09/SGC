Robust Artificial-neural-networks for k-space Interpolation RAKI is a recently proposed deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithm for parallel imaging. Its main premise is to perform k-space interpolation using convolutional neural networks CNNs trained on subject-specific autocalibration signal ACS data. Since training is performed individually for each subject the reconstruction time is longer than approaches that pre-train on databases. In this study we sought to reduce the computational time of RAKI. Optimized fast GPU implementation of robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space interpolation RAKI reconstruction.
