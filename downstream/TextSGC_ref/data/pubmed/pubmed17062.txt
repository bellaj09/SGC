"Portfolios have been used in the medical curriculum to evaluate difficult-to-assess areas such as students attitudes professionalism and teamwork. However their use early in a problem-based learning PBL course to foster deep learning and enhance students self-directed learning has not been adequately studied. The aims of this paper are to: 1 understand the uses of portfolios and the rationale for using reflection in the early years of a PBL curriculum; 2 discuss how to introduce portfolios and encourage students critical thinking skills not just reflection; and 3 provide students with tips that could enhance their skills in constructing good portfolios." Use of portfolios by medical students: significance of critical thinking.
