Face recognition "in the wild" has been revolutionized by the deployment of deep learning based approaches. In fact it has been extensively demonstrated that Deep Convolutional Neural Networks DCNNs are powerful enough to overcome most of the limits that affected face recognition algorithms based on hand-crafted features. These include variations in illumination pose expression and occlusion to mention some. The DCNNs discriminative power comes from the fact that low- and high-level representations are learned directly from the raw image data. As a consequence we expect the performance of a DCNN to be influenced by the characteristics of the image/video data that are fed to the network and their preprocessing. In this work we present a thorough analysis of several aspects that impact on the use of DCNN for face recognition. The evaluation has been carried out from two main perspectives: the network architecture and the similarity measures used to compare deeply learned features; the data source and quality and their preprocessing bounding box and alignment. Results obtained on the IJB-A MegaFace UMDFaces and YouTube Faces datasets indicate viable hints for designing training and testing DCNNs. Taking into account the outcomes of the experimental evaluation we show how competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art can be reached even with standard DCNN architectures and pipeline.
