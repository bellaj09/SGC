In this study we compared collaboration on a puzzle-solving task carried out by two persons in a virtual and a real environment. The task putting together a cube consisting of different colored blocks in a "Rubiks" cube-type puzzle was performed both in a shared virtual environment VE setting using a Cave-type virtual reality VR system networked with a desktop VR system and with cardboard colored blocks in an equivalent real setting. The aims of the study were to investigate presence co-presence collaboration leadership and performance in the two settings. We found that the participants contributed unequally to the task in the VE and also found differences in collaboration between the virtual and the real setting.
