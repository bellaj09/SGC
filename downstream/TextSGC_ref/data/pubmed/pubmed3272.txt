Romantic love is a cross-culturally universal phenomenon that serves as a commitment device for motivating pair bonding in human beings. Women and men may experience different feelings when viewing the same warm romantic scenes. To determine which brain systems may be involved in romance perception and examine possible sex differences we scanned 16 women and 16 men who were intensely in love using functional MRI. Participants were required to rate the romance level of 60 pictures showing romantic events that may frequently occur during romantic relationship formation. The results showed that greater brain activation was found for men in the insula PCC posterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal gyrus compared with women primarily under the High-romance condition. In addition enhanced functional connectivity between the brain regions involved in the High-romance condition in contrast to the Low-romance condition was only found for men. These data\xa0suggest that men and women differ in the processing of romantic information and that\xa0it may be\xa0 more effortful for men to perceive and evaluate romance degree.
