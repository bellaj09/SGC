"Nicotine consumption is considered a major health problem where many of those who wish to quit smoking relapse. The problem is that overtime smoking as behaviour is changing into a habit in which it is connected to internal e.g. nicotine level craving and external action time location triggers. Smoking cessation apps have proved their efficiency to support smoking who wish to quit smoking. However still these applications suffer from several drawbacks where they are highly relying on the user to initiate the intervention by submitting the factor the causes the urge to smoke. This research describes the creation of a combined Control Theory and deep learning model that can learn the smokers daily routine and predict smoking events. The models structure combines a Control Theory model of smoking with a 1D-CNN classifier to adapt to individual differences between smokers and predict smoking events based on motion and geolocation values collected using a mobile device. Data were collected from 5 participants in the UK and analysed and tested on 3 different machine learning model SVM Decision tree and 1D-CNN 1D-CNN has proved its efficiency over the three methods with average overall accuracy 86.6%. The average MSE of forecasting the nicotine level was 0.04 in the weekdays and 0.03 in the weekends. The model has proved its ability to predict the smoking event accurately when the participant is well engaged with the app." Towards a Smart Smoking Cessation App: A 1D-CNN Model Predicting Smoking Events.
