The decision-making process for estimating the optimal dosage is critical in clinical settings. In the neonatal intensive care unit NICU preterm neonates suffering from apnea of prematurity optimum drug dosage can make a difference between life and death. To improve clinical decision making in the NICU we have developed prediction models using machine learning algorithms. We have used optimized Support Vector Machine SVM decision trees with ensembles created using Bagging Boosting Random Forest optimized Multi Layer Perceptron MLP and Deep Learning to predict adequacy of caffeine a methylxanthine used to prevent the development of recurrent apneas to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. The respective models developed were evaluated using 100 clinical caffeine cases collected from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit NICU of Kasturba Medical College Manipal. Our results indicate that a deep belief network DBN having an area under curve AUC of 0.91 followed by an optimized MLP with the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology I SNAP I as an input feature outperform other models for assessing the drug effectiveness. Furthermore the optimized MLP followed by a DBN with SNAP I as an input feature is a more accurate model for predicting the therapeutic concentration of caffeine. These results suggest that the proposed SNAP I illness severity score acts as a critical input variable to enhance the performance of the prediction model. The machine learning approach is very useful for building decision support systems in the NICU in general and it provides specific solutions to optimize the administration of lifesaving drugs to neonates who are very sensitive to dosages. Using our method physicians can assess the adequacy and efficacy of caffeine on the study population in a NICU before administering it to neonates.
