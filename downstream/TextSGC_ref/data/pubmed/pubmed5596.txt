"Adaptive deep brain stimulation aDBS is an emerging method to alleviate the side effects and improve the efficacy of conventional open-loop stimulation for movement disorders. However current adaptive DBS techniques are primarily based on single-feature thresholding precluding an optimized delivery of stimulation for precise control of motor symptoms. Here we propose to use a machine learning approach for resting-state tremor detection from local field potentials LFPs recorded from subthalamic nucleus STN in 12 Parkinsons patients. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers and LFP-based biomarkers for tremor detection showing that the high-frequency oscillations and Hjorth parameters achieve a high discriminative performance. In addition using Kalman filtering in the feature space we show that the tremor detection performance significantly improves F115=32.16 p<0.0001. The proposed method holds great promise for efficient on-demand delivery of stimulation in Parkinsons disease."
