3D visualization and virtual reality are important trend in the development of modern science and technology and as well in the studies on biomedical engineering. This paper presents a computer procedure developed for 3D visualization in biomedical applications. The biomedical models are constructed in slice sequences based on polygon cells and information interaction is realized on the basis of OpenGL selection mode in particular consideration of the specialties in this field such as irregularity in geometry and complexity in material etc. The software developed has functions of 3D model construction and visualization real-time modeling transformation information interaction and so on. It could serve as useful platform for 3D visualization in biomedical engineering research. 3D visualization and information interaction in biomedical applications.
