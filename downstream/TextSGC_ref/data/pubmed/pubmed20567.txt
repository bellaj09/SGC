The combination of biological and artificial intelligence is particularly driven by two major strands of research: one involves the control of mechanical usually prosthetic devices by conscious biological subjects whereas the other involves the control of animal behaviour by stimulating nervous systems electrically or optically. However to our knowledge no study has demonstrated that spatial learning in a computer-based system can affect the learning and decision making behaviour of the biological component namely a rat when these two types of intelligence are wired together to form a new intelligent entity. Here we show how rule operations conducted by computing components contribute to a novel hybrid brain-computer system i.e. ratbots exhibit superior learning abilities in a maze learning task even when their vision and whisker sensation were blocked. We anticipate that our study will encourage other researchers to investigate combinations of various rule operations and other artificial intelligence algorithms with the learning and memory processes of organic brains to develop more powerful cyborg intelligence systems. Our results potentially have profound implications for a variety of applications in intelligent systems and neural rehabilitation. Maze learning by a hybrid brain-computer system.
