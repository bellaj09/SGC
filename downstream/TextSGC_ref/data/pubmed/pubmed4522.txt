Distracting emotional information impairs attention more in schizophrenia SCZ than in never-psychotic individuals. However it is unclear whether this impairment and its neural circuitry is indicative generally of psychosis or specifically of SCZ and whether it is even more specific to certain SCZ symptoms eg deficit syndrome. It is also unclear if this abnormality contributes to impaired behavioral performance and real-world functioning. Functional imaging data were recorded while individuals with SCZ bipolar disorder with psychosis BDP and no history of psychotic disorders CON attended to identity of faces while ignoring their emotional expressions. We examined group differences in functional connectivity between amygdala involved in emotional evaluation and sub-regions of medial prefrontal cortex MPFC involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control. Additionally we examined correlation of this connectivity with deficit syndrome and real-world functioning. Behaviorally SCZ showed the worst accuracy when matching the identity of emotional vs neutral faces. Neurally SCZ showed lower amygdala-MPFC connectivity than BDP and CON. BPD did not differ from CON neurally or behaviorally. In patients reduced amygdala-MPFC connectivity during emotional distractors was related to worse emotional vs neutral accuracy greater deficit syndrome severity and unemployment. Thus reduced amygdala-MPFC functional connectivity during emotional distractors reflects a deficit that is specific to SCZ. This reduction in connectivity is associated with worse clinical and real-world functioning. Overall these findings provide support for the specificity and clinical utility of amygdala-MPFC functional connectivity as a potential neural marker of SCZ.
