Simultaneous electroencephalography EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI allow us to study the active human brain from two perspectives concurrently. Signal processing based artifact reduction techniques are mandatory for this however to obtain reasonable EEG quality in simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Current artifact reduction techniques like average artifact subtraction AAS typically become less effective when artifact reduction has to be performed on-the-fly. We thus present and evaluate a new technique to improve EEG quality online. This technique adds up with online AAS and combines a prototype EEG-cap for reference recordings of artifacts with online adaptive filtering and is named reference layer adaptive filtering RLAF. We found online AAS\u2009+\u2009RLAF to be highly effective in improving EEG quality. Online AAS\u2009+\u2009RLAF outperformed online AAS and did so in particular online in terms of the chosen performance metrics these being specifically alpha rhythm amplitude ratio between closed and opened eyes 3-45% improvement signal-to-noise-ratio of visual evoked potentials VEP 25-63% improvement and VEPs variability 16-44% improvement. Further we found that EEG quality after online AAS\u2009+\u2009RLAF is occasionally even comparable with the offline variant of AAS at a 3T MRI scanner. In conclusion RLAF is a very effective add-on tool to enable high quality EEG in simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments even when online artifact reduction is necessary.
