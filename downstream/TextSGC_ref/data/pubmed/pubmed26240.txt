"In this study an oncology treatment planning system was developed by integrating the techniques of computer graphics virtual reality VR and three dimensional 3D image reconstruction. The virtual treatment room was constructed according to the real space and the 3D data of patients body was reconstructed from computer tomography CT slices in order to provide the 3D clinical information to compare with the therapy in real world. In addition the virtual multi-leaf collimator MLC was constructed to simulate and visualize both the radiation and irradiation fields. All objects in the system had been scaled down according to the true size. The system can be expected to save the preparation time and can be used for teaching and training prior to a real therapy." The development of a VR-based treatment planning system for oncology.
