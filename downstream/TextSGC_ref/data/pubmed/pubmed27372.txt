A brain-computer interface BCI is a device that detects signals from the brain and transforms them into useful commands. Researchers have developed BCIs that utilize different kinds of brain signals. These different BCI systems have differing characteristics such as the amount of training required and the degree to which they are or are not invasive. Much of the research on BCIs to date has involved healthy individuals and evaluation of classification algorithms. Some BCIs have been shown to have potential benefit for users with minimal muscular function resulting from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS. However there are still several challenges that need to be solved before BCIs can be clinically useful. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
