The research field of mental workload has attracted abundant researchers as mental workload plays a crucial role in real-life performance and safety. While previous studies have examined the neural correlates of mental workload in 2D scenarios i.e. presenting stimuli on a computer screen CS environment using univariate methods e.g. EEG channel power it is still unclear of the findings of one that uses multivariate approach using graphical theory and the effects of a 3D environment i.e. presenting stimuli on a Virtual Reality VR. In this study twenty subjects undergo flight simulation in both CS and VR environment with three stages each. After preprocessing the Electroencephalogram EEG signals were a connectivity matrix based on Phase Lag Index PLI will be constructed. Graph theory analysis then will be applied based on their global efficiency local efficiency and nodal efficiency on both alpha and theta band. For global efficiency and local efficiency VR values are generally lower than CS in both bands. For nodal efficiency the regions that show at least marginally significant decreases are very different for CS and VR. These findings suggest that 3D simulation effects a higher mental workload than 2D simulation and that they each involved a different brain region.
