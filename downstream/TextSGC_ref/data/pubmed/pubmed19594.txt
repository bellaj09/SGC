Several studies have demonstrated skills transfer after virtual reality VR simulation training in laparoscopic surgery. However the impact of VR simulation training on transfer of skills related to laparoscopic colectomy remains not investigated. The present study aimed at determining the impact of VR simulation warm-up on performance during laparoscopic colectomy in the porcine model. Short-duration virtual reality simulation training positively impacts performance during laparoscopic colectomy in animal model: results of a single-blinded randomized trial : VR warm-up for laparoscopic colectomy.
