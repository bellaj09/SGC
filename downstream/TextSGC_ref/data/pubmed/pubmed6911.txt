Suppression of bony structures in chest radiographs CXRs is potentially useful for radiologists and computer-aided diagnostic schemes. In this paper we present an effective deep learning method for bone suppression in single conventional CXR using deep convolutional neural networks ConvNets as basic prediction units. The deep ConvNets were adapted to learn the mapping between the gradients of the CXRs and the corresponding bone images. We propose a cascade architecture of ConvNets called CamsNet to refine progressively the predicted bone gradients in which the ConvNets work at successively increased resolutions. The predicted bone gradients at different scales from the CamsNet are fused in a maximum-a-posteriori framework to produce the final estimation of a bone image. This estimation of a bone image is subtracted from the original CXR to produce a soft-tissue image in which the bone components are eliminated. Our method was evaluated on a dataset that consisted of 504 cases of real two-exposure dual-energy subtraction chest radiographs 404 cases for training and 100 cases for test. The results demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality and high-resolution bone and soft-tissue images. The average relative mean absolute error of the produced bone images and peak signal-to-noise ratio of the produced soft-tissue images were 3.83% and 38.7dB respectively. The average bone suppression ratio of our method was 83.8% for the CXRs with pixel sizes of nearly 0.194mm. Furthermore we apply the trained CamsNet model on the CXRs acquired by various types of X-ray machines including scanned films and our method can also produce visually appealing bone and soft-tissue images.
