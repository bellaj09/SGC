A validated virtual reality laparoscopic simulator minimally invasive surgical trainer MIST 2 was used to assess the psychomotor skills of 21 gynaecologists 2 consultants 8 registrars and 11 senior house officers. Nine gynaecologists failed to complete the VR tasks at the first attempt and were excluded for sequential evaluation. Each of the remaining 12 gynaecologists were tested on MIST 2 on four occasions within four weeks. The MIST 2 simulator provided quantitative data on time to complete tasks errors economy of movement and economy of diathermy use--for both right and left hand performance. The results show a significant early learning curve for the majority of tasks which plateaued by the third session. This suggests a high quality surgeon-computer interface. MIST 2 provides objective assessment of laparoscopic skills in gynaecologists. Virtual reality laparoscopic simulator for assessment in gynaecology.
