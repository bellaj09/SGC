For many obesity is just a problem of energy input and expenditure: more energy input than expenditure. However the clinical practice and epidemiological data clearly show that weight control is more complex than expected by this simple equation. This is particularly true in morbid obesity a form of severe obesity in which a person\s Body Mass Index BMI kg/m2 is over 40. If we compare the definitions and diagnostic criteria for "dependence" and "addiction" with the situation of many severe obese subjects it is apparent that they match very well. Further different neurological studies confirm this similarity: both addiction and obesity patients have a deficiency of dopamine receptors. Nevertheless when we compare many of the actual obesity treatments with the ones used in the area of addictions it is possible to find relevant differences: obesity treatments neither consider different levels of type and intensity of care nor a multidimensional approach. To overcome these limitations in this paper we propose a bio-psychosocial approach in which the genetic influence lack of dopamine receptors is matched by psychosocial issues pressure for thinness and diet as main body image dissatisfaction treatment. Further the paper outlines how this approach may influence the treatment options by focusing both on the lessons coming from actual addiction treatment and the opportunities offered by virtual reality. Finally the paper presents and discusses the outcome of a controlled trial based on the proposed approach including a 6-month follow-up 211 morbid obese females with a BMI of >40 and a documented history of failures. Is severe obesity a form of addiction? Rationale clinical approach and controlled clinical trial.
