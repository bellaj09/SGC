Image evaluation of scar tissue plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Segmentation of the scar tissue is the first step towards evaluating the morphology of the scar tissue. Then with the use of CT images the deep learning approach can be applied to identify possible scar tissue in the left ventricular endocardial wall. An Automated Method for Detecting the Scar Tissue in the Left Ventricular Endocardial Wall Using Deep Learning Approach.
