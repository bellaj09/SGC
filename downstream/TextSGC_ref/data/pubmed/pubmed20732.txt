Gait training is an important component of rehabilitation after lower-extremity amputation. Abnormal gait performance often persists even for individuals who reacquire a high level of function. This case report describes the use of a virtual reality VR-based gait training program that provides real-time feedback in order to improve biomechanical and physiological performance. The aim of this case report is to describe the effects of the training in a person with a transfemoral amputation. Gait training with virtual reality-based real-time feedback: improving gait performance following transfemoral amputation.
