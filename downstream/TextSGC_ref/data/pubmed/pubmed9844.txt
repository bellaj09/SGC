Currently manual scoring is the gold standard of leg movement scoring LMs and periodic LMs PLMS in overnight polysomnography PSG studies which is subject to inter-scorer variability. The objective of this study is to design and validate an end-to-end deep learning system for the automatic scoring of LMs and PLMS in sleep. Design of a deep learning model for automatic scoring of periodic and non-periodic leg movements during sleep validated against multiple human experts.
