The rapid progress of gene expression profiling has facilitated the prosperity of recent biological studies in various fields where gene expression data characterizes various cell conditions and regulatory mechanisms under different experimental circumstances. Despite the widespread application of gene expression profiling and advances in high-throughput technologies profiling in genome-wide level is still expensive and difficult. Previous studies found that high correlation exists in the expression pattern of different genes such that a small subset of genes can be informative to approximately describe the entire transcriptome. In the Library of Integrated Network-based Cell-Signature program a set of 1000 landmark genes have been identified that contain 80% information of the whole genome and can be used to predict the expression of remaining genes. For a cost-effective profiling strategy traditional methods measure the profiles of landmark genes and then infer the expression of other target genes via linear models. However linear models do not have the capacity to capture the non-linear associations in gene regulatory networks. Conditional generative adversarial network for gene expression inference.
