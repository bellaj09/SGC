This paper presents an omnidirectional RGB-D RGB + Distance fusion sensor prototype using an actuated LIDAR Light Detection and Ranging and an RGB camera. Besides the sensor a novel mapping strategy is developed considering sensor scanning characteristics. The sensor can gather RGB and 3D data from any direction by toppling in 90 degrees a laser scan sensor and rotating it about its central axis. The mapping strategy is based on two environment maps a local map for instantaneous perception and a global map for perception memory. The 2D local map represents the surface in front of the robot and may contain RGB data allowing environment reconstruction and human detection similar to a sliding window that moves with a robot and stores surface data. Sliding Window Mapping for Omnidirectional RGB-D Sensors.
