Three-dimensional 3D computer modeling and interactive virtual reality VR simulation are validated teaching techniques used throughout medical disciplines. Little objective data exists supporting its use in teaching clinical anatomy. Learner motivation is thought to limit the rate of utilization of such novel technologies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness satisfaction and motivation associated with immersive VR simulation in teaching medical students neuroanatomy. Immersive virtual reality as a teaching tool for neuroanatomy.
