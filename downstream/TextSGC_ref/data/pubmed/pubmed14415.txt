"In recent years neural networks have enjoyed a renaissance as function approximators in reinforcement learning. Two decades after Tesauros TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit SiLU and its derivative function dSiLU. The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input. Second we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces instead of experience replay and softmax action selection can be competitive with DQN without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed approach by first achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10\xa0\xa010 board using TD learning and shallow dSiLU network agents and then by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units."
