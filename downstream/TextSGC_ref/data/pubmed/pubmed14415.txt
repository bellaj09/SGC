We present a deep learning approach to the indexing of electron backscatter diffraction EBSD patterns. We design and implement a deep convolutional neural network architecture to predict crystal orientation from the EBSD patterns. We design a differentiable approximation to the disorientation function between the predicted crystal orientation and the ground truth; the deep learning model optimizes for the mean disorientation error between the predicted crystal orientation and the ground truth using stochastic gradient descent. The deep learning model is trained using 374852 EBSD patterns of polycrystalline nickel from simulation and evaluated using 1000 experimental EBSD patterns of polycrystalline nickel. The deep learning model results in a mean disorientation error of 0.548 compared to 0.652 using dictionary based indexing.
