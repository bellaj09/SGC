We propose an alternative approach to "deep" learning that is based on computational ecologies of structurally diverse artificial neural networks and on dynamic associative memory responses to stimuli. Rather than focusing on massive computation of many different examples of a single situation we opt for model-based learning and adaptive flexibility. Cross-fertilization of learning processes across multiple domains is the fundamental feature of human intelligence that must inform "new" artificial intelligence.
