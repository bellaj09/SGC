Reconstructing three-dimensional 3D morphology of neurons is essential for understanding brain structures and functions. Over the past decades a number of neuron tracing tools including manual semiautomatic and fully automatic approaches have been developed to extract and analyze 3D neuronal structures. Nevertheless most of them were developed based on coding certain rules to extract and connect structural components of a neuron showing limited performance on complicated neuron morphology. Recently deep learning outperforms many other machine learning methods in a wide range of image analysis and computer vision tasks. Here we developed a new Open Source\xa0toolbox DeepNeuron which uses deep learning networks to learn features and rules from data and trace neuron morphology in light microscopy images. DeepNeuron provides a family of modules to solve basic yet challenging problems in neuron tracing. These problems include but not limited to: 1 detecting neuron signal under different image conditions 2 connecting neuronal signals into trees 3 pruning and refining tree morphology 4 quantifying the quality of morphology and 5 classifying dendrites and axons in real time. We have tested DeepNeuron using light microscopy images including bright-field and confocal images of human and mouse brain on which DeepNeuron demonstrates robustness and accuracy in neuron tracing.
