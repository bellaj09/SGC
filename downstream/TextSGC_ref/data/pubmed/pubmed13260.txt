Categorization of radiological images according to characteristics such as modality scanner parameters body part etc is important for quality control clinical efficiency and research. The metadata associated with images stored in the DICOM format reliably captures scanner settings such as tube current in CT or echo time TE in MRI. Other parameters such as image orientation body part examined and presence of intravenous contrast however are not inherent to the scanner settings and therefore require user input which is prone to human error. There is a general need for automated approaches that will appropriately categorize images even with parameters that are not inherent to the scanner settings. These approaches should be able to process both planar 2D images and full 3D scans. In this work we present a deep learning based approach for automatically detecting one such parameter: the presence or absence of intravenous contrast in 3D MRI scans. Contrast is manually injected by radiology staff during the imaging examination and its presence cannot be automatically recorded in the DICOM header by the scanner. Our classifier is a convolutional neural network CNN based on the ResNet architecture. Our data consisted of 1000 breast MRI scans 500 scans with and 500 scans without intravenous contrast used for training and testing a CNN on 80%/20% split respectively. The labels for the scans were obtained from the series descriptions created by certified radiological technologists. Preliminary results of our classifier are very promising with an area under the ROC curve AUC of 0.98 sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.9 respectively at the optimal ROC cut-off point demonstrating potential usefulness in both clinical as well as research settings.
