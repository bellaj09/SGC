Pseudoprogression PsP occurs in 20-30% of patients with glioblastoma multiforme GBM after receiving the standard treatment. PsP exhibits similarities in shape and intensity to the true tumor progression TTP of GBM on the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging MRI. These similarities pose challenges to the differentiation of these types of progression and hence the selection of the appropriate clinical treatment strategy.
