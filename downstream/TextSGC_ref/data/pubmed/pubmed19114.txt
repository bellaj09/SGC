Patients diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa RP show in the advanced stage of the disease severely restricted peripheral vision causing poor mobility and decline in quality of life. This vision loss causes difficulty identifying obstacles and their relative distances. Thus RP patients use mobility aids such as canes to navigate especially in dark environments. A number of high-tech visual aids using virtual reality VR and sensory substitution have been developed to support or supplant traditional visual aids. These have not achieved widespread use because they are difficult to use or block off residual vision. This paper presents a unique depth to high-contrast pseudocolor mapping overlay developed and tested on a Microsoft Hololens 1 as a low vision aid for RP patients. A single-masked and randomized trial of the AR pseudocolor low vision aid to evaluate real world mobility and near obstacle avoidance was conducted consisting of 10 RP subjects. An FDA-validated functional obstacle course and a custom-made grasping setup were used. The use of the AR visual aid reduced collisions by 50% in mobility testing p\u2009=\u20090.02 and by 70% in grasp testing p\u2009=\u20090.03. This paper introduces a new technique the pseudocolor wireframe and reports the first significant statistics showing improvements for the population of RP patients with mobility and grasp.
