RNA sequencing technique RNA-seq enables scientists to develop novel data-driven methods for discovering more unidentified lincRNAs. Meantime knowledge-based technologies are experiencing a potential revolution ignited by the new deep learning methods. By scanning the newly found data set from RNA-seq scientists have found that: 1 the expression of lincRNAs appears to be regulated that is the relevance exists along the DNA sequences; 2 lincRNAs contain some conversed patterns/motifs tethered together by non-conserved regions. The two evidences give the reasoning for adopting knowledge-based deep learning methods in lincRNA detection. Similar to coding region transcription non-coding regions are split at transcriptional sites. However regulatory RNAs rather than message RNAs are generated. That is the transcribed RNAs participate the biological process as regulatory units instead of generating proteins. Identifying these transcriptional regions from non-coding regions is the first step towards lincRNA recognition. A deep learning method for lincRNA detection using auto-encoder algorithm.
