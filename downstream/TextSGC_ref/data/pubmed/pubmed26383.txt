Understanding the mode of generation and the statistical structure of neurological noise is one of the central problems of biomedical signal processing. We have developed a broad class of abstract biological noise sources we call hidden simplicial tissues. In the simplest cases such tissue emits what we have named generalized van der Ziel-McWhorter GVZM noise which has a roughly 1/f spectral roll-off. Our previous work focused on the statistical structure of GVZM frequency spectra. However causality of processing operations i.e. dependence only on the past is an essential requirement for real-time applications to seizure detection and brain-computer interfacing. In this paper we outline the theoretical background for optimal causal time-domain filtering of deterministic signals embedded in GVZM noise. We present some of our early findings concerning the optimal filtering of EEG signals for the detection of steady-state visual evoked potential SSVEP responses and indicate the next steps in our ongoing research. Optimal causal filtering for 1 /f-type noise in single-electrode EEG signals.
