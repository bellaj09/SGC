Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever-increasing stream of geospatial data but current approaches may not be optimal when system behaviour is dominated by spatial or temporal context. Here rather than amending classical machine learning we argue that these contextual cues should be used as part of deep learning an approach that is able to extract spatio-temporal features automatically to gain further process understanding of Earth system science problems improving the predictive ability of seasonal forecasting and modelling of long-range spatial connections across multiple timescales for example. The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.
