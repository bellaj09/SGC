Sparse-view computed tomography CT holds great promise for speeding up data acquisition and reducing radiation dose in CT scans. Recent advances in reconstruction algorithms for sparse-view CT such as iterative reconstruction algorithms obtained high-quality image while requiring advanced computing power. Lately deep learning DL has been widely used in various applications and has obtained many remarkable outcomes. In this paper we propose a new method for sparse-view CT reconstruction based on the DL approach. The method can be divided into two steps. First filter backprojection FBP was used to reconstruct the CT image from sparsely sampled sinogram. Then the FBP results were fed to a DL neural network which is a DenseNet and deconvolution-based network DD-Net. The DD-Net combines the advantages of DenseNet and deconvolution and applies shortcut connections to concatenate DenseNet and deconvolution to accelerate the training speed of the network; all of those operations can greatly increase the depth of network while enhancing the expression ability of the network. After the training the proposed DD-Net achieved a competitive performance relative to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of streaking artifacts removal and structure preservation. Compared with the other state-of-the-art reconstruction methods the DD-Net method can increase the structure similarity by up to 18% and reduce the root mean square error by up to 42%. These results indicate that DD-Net has great potential for sparse-view CT image reconstruction. A Sparse-View CT Reconstruction Method Based on Combination of DenseNet and Deconvolution.
