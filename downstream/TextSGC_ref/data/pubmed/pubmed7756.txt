In industrial processes inferential sensors have been extensively applied for prediction of quality variables that are difficult to measure online directly by hard sensors. Deep learning is a recently developed technique for feature representation of complex data which has great potentials in soft sensor modeling. However it often needs a large number of representative data to train and obtain a good deep network. Moreover layer-wise pretraining often causes information loss and generalization degradation of high hidden layers. This greatly limits the implementation and application of deep learning networks in industrial processes. In this article a layer-wise data augmentation LWDA strategy is proposed for the pretraining of deep learning networks and soft sensor modeling. In particular the LWDA-based stacked autoencoder LWDA-SAE is developed in detail. Finally the proposed LWDA-SAE model is applied to predict the 10% and 50% boiling points of the aviation kerosene in an industrial hydrocracking process. The results show that the LWDA-SAE-based soft sensor is superior to multilayer perceptron traditional SAE and the SAE with data augmentation only for its input layer IDA-SAE. Moreover LWDA-SAE can converge at a faster speed with a lower learning error than the other methods.
