The innate detail of the cerebrovasculature is a demonstration of the structural complexity exhibited within the nervous system and highlights the challenges intrinsic to surgically influencing this system. Bridging the knowledge gap between the 2-dimentional learning environment and the 3-dimensional 3D clinical setting is a challenge requiring experience. Computer graphic technology provides an opportunity for the learner to step into a new era of learning via the use of interactive 3D models and virtual reality.
