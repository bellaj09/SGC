Mycoplasma synoviae MS is an important poultry pathogen worldwide. This bacterium may cause eggshell changes including an altered shell surface thinning and increased translucency in different areas which leads to a greater incidence of eggshell cracks and breaks. In the present study the association between experimental infection of birds with two field strains of MS from different genotypes and the production of abnormal eggs is described. The analysis of those eggshells using a full-field optical coherence tomography FF OCT scanner is also reported. Eggshell apex abnormalities caused by two different Mycoplasma synoviae genotypes and evaluation of eggshell anomalies by full-field optical coherence tomography.
