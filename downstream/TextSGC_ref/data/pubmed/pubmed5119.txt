In the mammalian neocortex the capacity to dynamically route and coordinate the exchange of information between areas is a critical feature of cognitive function enabling processes such as higher-level sensory processing and sensorimotor integration. Despite the importance attributed to long-range connections between cortical areas their exact operations and role in cortical function remain an open question. In recent years progress has been made in understanding long-range cortical circuits through work focused on the mouse sensorimotor whisker system. In this review we examine recent studies dissecting long-range circuits involved in whisker sensorimotor processing as an entry point for understanding the rules that govern long-range cortical circuit function. Long-range cortical dynamics: a perspective from the mouse sensorimotor whisker system.
