The field of temporal bone simulation TBS has largely focused on the development and validation of simulators as training and assessment tools. As technology has progressed over the years researchers have however envisioned new clinical applications for simulators extending to preoperative surgical planning and case rehearsal. The purpose of this article was to review the current state of the art in TBS and to highlight recent advancements in the field. Because of space limitations we will limit our discussion to computer-based virtual reality simulators. Preoperative preparation for otologic surgery: temporal bone simulation.
