In automatic paper currency sorting fitness classification is a technique that assesses the quality of banknotes to determine whether a banknote is suitable for recirculation or should be replaced. Studies on using visible-light reflection images of banknotes for evaluating their usability have been reported. However most of them were conducted under the assumption that the denomination and input direction of the banknote are predetermined. In other words a pre-classification of the type of input banknote is required. To address this problem we proposed a deep learning-based fitness-classification method that recognizes the fitness level of a banknote regardless of the denomination and input direction of the banknote to the system using the reflection images of banknotes by visible-light one-dimensional line image sensor and a convolutional neural network CNN. Experimental results on the banknote image databases of the Korean won KRW and the Indian rupee INR with three fitness levels and the Unites States dollar USD with two fitness levels showed that our method gives better classification accuracy than other methods.
