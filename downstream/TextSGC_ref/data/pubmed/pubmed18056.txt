"This article discusses the need for and value of providing students with instruction in how to use comprehension strategies as well as the effectiveness of inducing strategy use through cognitive disequilibrium. The leading assumption that guides this article is that learning facts and figures is not enough. Students need to build deep knowledge that is interconnected coherent and includes understanding of potential causal mechanisms. Doing so requires going beyond the printed page by generating inferences and developing coherent explanations. Inferences and explanations allow the student to make links between concepts in the material and importantly to make connections to prior knowledge. These connections render students understanding of new material more coherent and in consequence deeper and more stable." Strategies to read and learn: overcoming learning by consumption.
