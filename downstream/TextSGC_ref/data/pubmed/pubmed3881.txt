Interest has recently grown in multi-center studies which have more power than smaller studies in conducting sophisticated evaluations of basic neuroanatomy and neurodegenerative disorders. The large number of subjects that result from pooling multi-center datasets increases sensitivity but also introduces a between-center variance component. Taking sex differences as an example we examined the effects of different ratios of cases to controls males to females between scanners in multi-scanner morphometric studies using voxel-based morphometry and data obtained on two scanners of the exact same model. Each subject was scanned twice with both scanners. Using the image obtained on either of the two scanners for each subject voxel-based analyses were repeated with different ratios of males to females for each scanner. As the ratio of males to females became more imbalanced between the scanners the differences between the two scanners more strongly affected the results of analyses of sex differences. When the ratio of males to females was balanced the inclusion of scanner as a covariate in the statistical analysis had almost no influence on the results of analyses of sex differences. When the ratio of males to females was ill-balanced the inclusion of scanner as a covariate suppressed scanner effects on the results but made sex differences less likely to become significant. The present results suggest that as long as the ratio of cases to controls is well-balanced across different scanners it is not always necessary to include scanner as a covariate in the statistical analysis and that when the ratio of cases to controls is ill-balanced across scanners the inclusion of scanner as a covariate in the statistical analysis can suppress scanner effects but may make differences less likely to be detected.
