"ICD-9 the Ninth Revision of International Classification of Diseases is widely used to describe a patients diagnosis. Accurate automated ICD-9 coding is important because manual coding is expensive time-consuming and inefficient. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning in this study we present a deep learning framework called DeepLabeler to automatically assign ICD-9 codes. DeepLabeler combines the convolutional neural network with the Document to Vector technique to extract and encode local and global features. Our proposed DeepLabeler demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance i.e. 0.335 micro F-measure on MIMIC-II dataset and 0.408 micro F-measure on MIMIC-III dataset. It outperforms classical hierarchy-based SVM and flat-SVM both on these two datasets by at least 14 percent. Furthermore we analyze the deep neural network structure to discover the vital elements in the success of DeepLabeler. We find that the convolutional neural network is the most effective component in our network and the Document to Vector technique is also necessary for enhancing classification performance since it extracts well-recognized global features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the great promise of deep learning techniques in the field of text multi-label classification and automated medical coding."
