The limitations of traditional computer-aided detection CAD systems for mammography the extreme importance of early detection of breast cancer and the high impact of the false diagnosis of patients drive researchers to investigate deep learning DL methods for mammograms MGs. Recent breakthroughs in DL in particular convolutional neural networks CNNs have achieved remarkable advances in the medical fields. Specifically CNNs are used in mammography for lesion localization and detection risk assessment image retrieval and classification tasks. CNNs also help radiologists providing more accurate diagnosis by delivering precise quantitative analysis of suspicious lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks for mammography: advances challenges and applications.
