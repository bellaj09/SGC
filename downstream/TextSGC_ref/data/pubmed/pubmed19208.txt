Ultrasound exams need skilled examiners and simulation-based training could provide standardized and safe skill training. This study aims to give an overview of different types of virtual-reality simulators for use in abdominal diagnostic ultrasound training in radiology. Fifteen specialized radiologists and radiological residents were presented with two similar cases on four different simulators for abdominal ultrasound training. A feedback sheet for each individual simulator and for an overall comparison was filled out by all participants. All means of scores were compared and simulators were ranked from least to most favorable. One simulator was ranked most favorable in seven out of nine questions but none of the mean scores had statistically significant differences. All simulators were recommended for training radiologists and all simulators were perceived to benefit trainees more than experienced ultra-sonographers.
