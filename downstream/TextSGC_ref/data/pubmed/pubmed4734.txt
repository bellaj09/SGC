Traumatic brain injury TBI often has long-term debilitating sequelae in cognitive and behavioral domains. Understanding how TBI impacts functional integrity of brain networks that underlie these domains is key to guiding future approaches to TBI rehabilitation. In the current study we investigated the differences in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity FC of resting state networks RSNs between chronic mild-to-severe TBI patients and normal comparisons NC focusing on two externally oriented networks i.e. the fronto-parietal network FPN and the executive control network ECN one internally oriented network i.e. the default mode network DMN and one somato-motor network SMN. Seed voxel correlation analysis revealed that TBI patients displayed significantly less FC between lateralized seeds and both homologous and non-homologous regions in the opposite hemisphere for externally oriented networks but not for DMN or SMN; conversely TBI patients showed increased FC within regions of the DMN especially precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus. Region of interest correlation analyses confirmed the presence of significantly higher inter-hemispheric FC in NC for the FPN p\u2009<\u20090.01 and ECN p\u2009<\u20090.05 but not for the DMN p\u2009>\u20090.05 or SMN p\u2009>\u20090.05. Further analysis revealed that performance on a neuropsychological test measuring organizational skills and visuo-spatial abilities administered to the TBI group the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test positively correlated with FC between the right FPN and homologous regions. Our findings suggest that distinct RSNs display specific patterns of aberrant FC following TBI; this represents a step forward in the search for biomarkers useful for early diagnosis and treatment of TBI-related cognitive impairment.
