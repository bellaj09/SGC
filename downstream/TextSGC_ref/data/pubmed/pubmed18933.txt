The individual and combined effects of posthypnotic suggestion PHS and virtual reality distraction VRD on experimentally induced thermal pain were examined using a 2 x 2 between-groups design. After receiving baseline thermal pain each participant received hypnosis or no hypnosis followed by VRD or no VRD during another pain stimulus. Consistent with the hypothesis that hypnosis and VRD work via different mechanisms results show that posthypnotic analgesia was moderated by hypnotizability but VRD analgesia was not. The impact of PHSs for analgesia was specific to high hypnotizables whereas VRD was effective independent of hypnotizability. Results also show a nonsignificant but predicted pattern for high hypnotizables: Audio hypnosis combined with VRD reduced worst pain 22% more and pain unpleasantness 25% more than did VRD alone. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. Analgesic effects of posthypnotic suggestions and virtual reality distraction on thermal pain.
