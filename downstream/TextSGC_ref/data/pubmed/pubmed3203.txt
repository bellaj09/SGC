In many functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies blind humans were found to show cross-modal reorganization engaging the visual system in non-visual tasks. For example blind people can manage to understand synthetic spoken language at very high speaking rates up to ca. 20 syllables/s syl/s. FMRI data showed that hemodynamic activation within right-hemispheric primary visual cortex V1 bilateral pulvinar Pv and left-hemispheric supplementary motor area pre-SMA covaried with their capability of ultra-fast speech 16 syllables/s comprehension. It has been suggested that right V1 plays an important role with respect to the perception of ultra-fast speech features particularly the detection of syllable onsets. Furthermore left pre-SMA seems to be an interface between these syllabic representations and the frontal speech processing and working memory network. So far little is known about the networks linking V1 to Pv auditory cortex A1 and mesio- frontal areas. Dynamic causal modeling DCM was applied to investigate i the input structure from A1 and Pv toward right V1 and ii output from right V1 and A1 to left pre-SMA. As concerns the input Pv was significantly connected to V1 in addition to A1 in blind participants but not in sighted controls. Regarding the output V1 was significantly connected to pre-SMA in blind individuals and the strength of V1-SMA connectivity correlated with the performance of ultra-fast speech comprehension. By contrast in sighted controls not understanding ultra-fast speech pre-SMA did neither receive input from A1 nor V1. Taken together right V1 might facilitate the "parsing" of the ultra-fast speech stream in blind subjects by receiving subcortical auditory input via the Pv = secondary visual pathway and transmitting this information toward contralateral pre-SMA.
