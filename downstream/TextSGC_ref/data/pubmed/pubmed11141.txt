Acoustic data provide scientific and engineering insights in fields ranging from biology and communications to ocean and Earth science. We survey the recent advances and transformative potential of machine learning ML including deep learning in the field of acoustics. ML is a broad family of techniques which are often based in statistics for automatically detecting and utilizing patterns in data. Relative to conventional acoustics and signal processing ML is data-driven. Given sufficient training data ML can discover complex relationships between features and desired labels or actions or between features themselves. With large volumes of training data ML can discover models describing complex acoustic phenomena such as human speech and reverberation. ML in acoustics is rapidly developing with compelling results and significant future promise. We first introduce ML then highlight ML developments in four acoustics research areas: source localization in speech processing source localization in ocean acoustics bioacoustics and environmental sounds in everyday scenes.
