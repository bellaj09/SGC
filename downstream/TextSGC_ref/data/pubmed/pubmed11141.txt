"Quantifying gait and postural control adds valuable information that aids in understanding neurological conditions where motor symptoms predominate and cause considerable functional impairment. Disease-specific clinical scales exist; however they are often susceptible to subjectivity and can lack sensitivity when identifying subtle gait and postural impairments in prodromal cohorts and longitudinally to document disease progression. Numerous devices are available to objectively quantify a range of measurement outcomes pertaining to gait and postural control; however efforts are required to standardise and harmonise approaches that are specific to the neurological condition and clinical assessment. Tools are urgently needed that address a number of unmet needs in neurological practice. Namely these include timely and accurate diagnosis; disease stratification; risk prediction; tracking disease progression; and decision making for intervention optimisation and maximising therapeutic response such as medication selection disease staging and targeted support. Using some recent examples of research across a range of relevant neurological conditions-including Parkinsons disease ataxia and dementia-we will illustrate evidence that supports progress against these unmet clinical needs. We summarise the novel big data approaches that utilise data mining and machine learning techniques to improve disease classification and risk prediction and conclude with recommendations for future direction."
