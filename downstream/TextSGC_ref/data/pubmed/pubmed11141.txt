Anatomy has in history been linked to helpful ways to remember structures branches of nerves structures passing through foramina etc. Scalp is even a mnemonic in itself Skin Connective tissue Aponeurosis Loose areolar tissue Pericranium. There has been concern by some educators that using mnemonics or rhymes promotes a surface approach to learning and is unhelpful in establishing long-term and meaningful deep learning. This article argues that mnemonics and rhyme can be used in the appropriate way at the right time by students as an important learning strategy. That strategy can help lay a foundation of knowledge to be developed and later built upon or simply recall information more easily. Mnemonics like all information that is to be recalled is consolidated by rehearsal. In examining the neuroanatomy of learning theories it is therefore possible to suggest that when students begin to learn an area of anatomy such as the cranial nerves using a mnemonic or rhyme it can help students remember the names and facilitate the engagement of the working memory processes assisting the student to build a construct for subsequent deeper layers of knowledge. Modern approaches to anatomy education involve a myriad of learning opportunities but educators must assess the value of each one before recommending them to students. It appears that using mnemonics and rhyme is as valid today as it has been for centuries. The Twelve Cranial Nerves of Christmas: Mnemonics Rhyme and Anatomy - Seeing the Lighter Side.
