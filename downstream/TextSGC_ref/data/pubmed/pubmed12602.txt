The level of PD-L1 expression in immunohistochemistry IHC assays is a key biomarker for the identification of Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer NSCLC patients that may respond to anti PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. The quantification of PD-L1 expression currently includes the visual estimation by a pathologist of the percentage tumor proportional scoring or TPS of tumor cells showing PD-L1 staining. Known challenges like differences in positivity estimation around clinically relevant cut-offs and sub-optimal quality of samples makes visual scoring tedious and subjective yielding a scoring variability between pathologists. In this work we propose a novel deep learning solution that enables the first automated and objective scoring of PD-L1 expression in late stage NSCLC needle biopsies. To account for the low amount of tissue available in biopsy images and to restrict the amount of manual annotations necessary for training we explore the use of semi-supervised approaches against standard fully supervised methods. We consolidate the manual annotations used for training as well the visual TPS scores used for quantitative evaluation with multiple pathologists. Concordance measures computed on a set of slides unseen during training provide evidence that our automatic scoring method matches visual scoring on the considered dataset while ensuring repeatability and objectivity.
