Mammographic breast density is an established risk marker for breast cancer and is visually assessed by radiologists in routine mammogram image reading using four qualitative Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System BI-RADS breast density categories. It is particularly difficult for radiologists to consistently distinguish the two most common and most variably assigned BI-RADS categories i.e. "scattered density" and "heterogeneously dense". The aim of this work was to investigate a deep learning-based breast density classifier to consistently distinguish these two categories aiming at providing a potential computerized tool to assist radiologists in assigning a BI-RADS category in current clinical workflow. A deep learning method for classifying mammographic breast density categories.
