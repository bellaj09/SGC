COGITAT is an automated hole board system that following minimal experimental interventions makes it possible to measure a variety of parameters associated with learning memory relearning cognition and cognitive shifts but also changes in exploratory and sensorimotor performance in rodent models. The individual parameters--that is overall exploratory activity number of visits deep in the hole into or inspections of at the upper surface holes number of baited unbaited or previously baited holes visited or inspected reinspections of or revisits into any holes number of pellets eaten time to find pellets serial order collection without intermediate inspections or visits and reference and working memory errors visits inspections or total--are obtained simultaneously and the results are immediately available after the end of each experiment. The system appears to be well suited to neurophysiological neuropharmacological and gene-technological investigations in rodent models. The analysis system COGITAT for the study of cognitive deficiencies in rodents.
