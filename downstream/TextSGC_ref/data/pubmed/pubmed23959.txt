In this paper a new rehabilitation training system was developed to improve equilibrium sense control by combining virtual reality technology with a fixed exercise bicycle. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the training system twenty normal healthy adults participated as test subjects in the investigation of the influence of different the parameters on equilibrium sensory control. Several factors including path deviation cycling time cycling velocity center of pressure were evaluated and analyzed quantitatively. Also we investigated the usefulness of virtual feedback information for weight shift on the improvement of the effect of equilibrium training. After conducting repeated tests we found improvements not only in of the ability to controlling balance and weight shift but also in the overall cycling capabilities such as cycling speed. Therefore the new training system utilizing an excise bike and a virtual reality system is found to be effective on the improvement of equilibrium sense and the technology we have developed seems to have a good prospect in the rehabilitation field. The development of a new training system for improving equilibrium sense using a virtual bicycle simulator.
