During recent years the digital revolution has changed the face of societies including industrial production economies and peoples\ social lives. From these changes we may extrapolate the developments that digitization of health care will bring to medicine in general and laboratory medicine in particular. Disruptive technologies will fundamentally change the way laboratory tests are going to be ordered carried out and interpreted in the future and test results from various sources need to be curated to be of added value for the patient\s condition. Wearables and implantables will quantify the concentrations for an unknown number of laboratory parameters and the data will be stored in cloud services at the fingertips of the patient as the sovereign of his/her health care data. A 24/7 online availability of health services will strengthen predictive medicine and may enable a vastly improved preventive health care that is supported by deep-learning algorithms for clinical decision-making not only on behalf of the physician but also the empowered patient e.g. health bots. This will likely shift the current role of Laboratory Medicine as a central provider of diagnostic information from a "hidden champion" towards a higher visibility redefining the patient-physician-laboratory relationship. For example accessing digital health data will allow Laboratory Medicine to more efficiently contribute to the medical dialog than is often the case today. From this perspective this will require major readjustments in the way we execute our profession and it will also need new concepts of education and continuous professional development.
