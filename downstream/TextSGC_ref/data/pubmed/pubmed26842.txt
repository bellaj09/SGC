Deep brain stimulation DBS is a developing technology. New generations of DBS technology are already in the pipeline yet this particular fact has been largely ignored among ethicists interested in DBS. Focusing only on ethical concerns raised by the current DBS technology is albeit necessary not sufficient. Since current bioethical concerns raised by a specific technology could be quite different from the concerns it will raise a couple of years ahead an ethical analysis should be sensitive to such alterations or it could end up with results that soon become dated. The goal of this analysis is to address these changing bioethical concerns to think ahead on upcoming and future DBS concerns both in terms of a changing technology and changing moral attitudes. By employing the distinction between inherent and noninherent bioethical concerns we identify and make explicit the particular limits and potentials for change within each category respectively including how present and upcoming bioethical concerns regarding DBS emerge and become obsolete. Many of the currently identified ethical problems with DBS such as stimulation-induced mania are a result of suboptimal technology. These challenges could be addressed by technical advances while for instance perceptions of an altered body image caused by the mere awareness of having an implant may not. Other concerns will not emerge until the technology has become sophisticated enough for new uses to be realized such as concerns on DBS for enhancement purposes. As a part of the present analysis concerns regarding authenticity are used as an example. Thinking Ahead on Deep Brain Stimulation: An Analysis of the Ethical Implications of a Developing Technology.
