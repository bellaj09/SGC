Interest for deep learning in radiology has increased tremendously in the past decade due to the high achievable performance for various computer vision tasks such as detection segmentation classification monitoring and prediction. This article provides step-by-step practical guidance for conducting a project that involves deep learning in radiology from defining specifications to deployment and scaling. Specifically the objectives of this article are to provide an overview of clinical use cases of deep learning describe the composition of multi-disciplinary team and summarize current approaches to patient data model and hardware selection. Key ideas will be illustrated by examples from a prototypical project on imaging of colorectal liver metastasis. This article illustrates the workflow for liver lesion detection segmentation classification monitoring and prediction of tumor recurrence and patient survival. Challenges are discussed including ethical considerations cohorting data collection anonymization and availability of expert annotations. The practical guidance may be adapted to any project that requires automated medical image analysis. Deep learning workflow in radiology: a primer.
