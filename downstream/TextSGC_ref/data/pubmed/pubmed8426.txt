Elderly population over the age of 60 is predicted to be 1.2 billion by 2025. Most of the elderly people would like to stay alone in their own house due to the high eldercare cost and privacy invasion. Unobtrusive activity recognition is the most preferred solution for monitoring daily activities of the elderly people living alone rather than the camera and wearable devices based systems. Thus we propose an unobtrusive activity recognition classifier using deep convolutional neural network DCNN and anonymous binary sensors that are passive infrared motion sensors and door sensors. We employed Aruba annotated open data set that was acquired from a smart home where a voluntary single elderly woman was living inside for eight months. First ten basic daily activities namely Eating Bed_to_Toilet Relax Meal_Preparation Sleeping Work Housekeeping Wash_Dishes Enter_Home and Leave_Home are segmented with different sliding window sizes and then converted into binary activity images. Next the activity images are employed as the ground truth for the proposed DCNN model. The 10-fold cross-validation evaluation results indicated that our proposed DCNN model outperforms the existing models with F1-score of 0.79 and 0.951 for all ten activities and eight activities excluding Leave_Home and Wash_Dishes respectively.
