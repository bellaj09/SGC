"Olfaction can enhance the experience of music films computer games and virtual reality applications. However this area is less explored than other areas such as computer graphics and audio. Most advanced olfactory displays are designed for a specific experiment they are hard to modify and extend expensive and/or can deliver a very limited number of scents. Additionally current-generation olfactory displays make no decisions on if and when a scent should be released. This paper proposes a low-cost easy to build powerful smart olfactory display that can release up to 24 different aromas and allow control of the quantity of the released aroma. The display is capable of absorbing back the aroma in an attempt to clean the air prior to releasing a new aroma. Additionally the display includes a smart algorithm that will decide when to release certain aromas. The device controller application includes releasing scents based on a timer text in English subtitles or input from external software applications. This allows certain applications such as games to decide when to release a scent making it ideal for gaming. The device also supports native connectivity with games developed using a game development asset developed as part of this project. The project was evaluated by 15 subjects and it was proved to have high accuracy when the scents were released with 1.5 minutes delay from each other." Towards Smart Gaming Olfactory Displays.
