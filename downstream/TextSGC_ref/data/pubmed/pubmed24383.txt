"Implantable neural electrode technologies for chronic neural recordings can restore functional control to paralysis and limb loss victims through brain-machine interfaces. These probes however have high failure rates partly due to the biological responses to the probe which generate an inflammatory scar and subsequent neuronal cell death. L1 is a neuronal specific cell adhesion molecule and has been shown to minimize glial scar formation and promote electrode-neuron integration when covalently attached to the surface of neural probes. In this work the acute microglial response to L1-coated neural probes was evaluated in\xa0vivo by implanting coated devices into the cortex of mice with fluorescently labeled microglia and tracking microglial dynamics with multi-photon microscopy for the ensuing 6\xa0h in order to understand L1s cellular mechanisms of action. Microglia became activated immediately after implantation extending processes towards both L1-coated and uncoated control probes at similar velocities. After the processes made contact with the probes microglial processes expanded to cover 47.7% of the control probes surfaces. For L1-coated probes however there was a statistically significant 83% reduction in microglial surface coverage. This effect was sustained through the experiment. At 6\xa0h post-implant the radius of microglia activation was reduced for the L1 probes by 20% shifting from 130.0 to 103.5\xa0m with the coating. Microglia as far as 270\xa0m from the implant site displayed significantly lower morphological characteristics of activation for the L1 group. These results suggest that the L1 surface treatment works in an acute setting by microglial mediated mechanisms." Neuroadhesive L1 coating attenuates acute microglial attachment to neural electrodes as revealed by live two-photon microscopy.
