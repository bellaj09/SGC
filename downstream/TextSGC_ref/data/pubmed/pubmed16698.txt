We reviewed the literature on distance training for the restoration of motor function. Computerized literature searches were performed using the MEDLINE EMBASE Cinahl and Cochrane databases. Articles that met the criteria for inclusion were divided into three general areas concerning the type of training in relation to motor functions--muscle/joint balance and cognition. From the publications identified in the literature search 11 articles met the selection criteria. Six were related to muscle/joint functions four to balance functions and one to cognitive functions. The articles were graded according to the strength of the scientific evidence they offered. The review revealed some promising applications of distance motor training such as virtual reality VR and robotic devices. The strength of the evidence from these studies was poor however probably because the technology is relatively new. In contrast to the studies using VR and robotic devices those using electromyographic EMG biofeedback showed a good to fair strength of scientific evidence. This can be explained by the substantial history of research on the restoration of motor function through the use of EMG biofeedback techniques. When implemented in clinical practice these applications could reduce the pressure on scarce health-care resources. Distance training for the restoration of motor function.
