This paper argues that Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Network BI-SNN architectures can learn and reveal deep in time-space functional and structural patterns from spatio-temporal data. These patterns can be represented as deep knowledge in a partial case in the form of deep spatio-temporal rules. This is a promising direction for building new types of Brain-Computer Interfaces called Brain-Inspired Brain-Computer Interfaces BI-BCI. A theoretical framework and its experimental validation on deep knowledge extraction and representation using SNN are presented. Deep learning and deep knowledge representation in Spiking Neural Networks for Brain-Computer Interfaces.
