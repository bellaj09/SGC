The aim of this work is to generate synthetic computed tomography sCT images from multi-sequence magnetic resonance MR images using an adversarial network and to assess the feasibility of sCT-based treatment planning for brain radiotherapy. Datasets for 15 patients with glioblastoma were selected and 580 pairs of CT and MR images were used. T1-weighted T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR sequences were combined to create a three-channel image as input data. A conditional generative adversarial network cGAN was trained using image patches. The image quality was evaluated using voxel-wise mean absolute errors MAEs of the CT number. For the dosimetric evaluation 3D conformal radiotherapy 3D-CRT and volumetric modulated arc therapy VMAT plans were generated using the original CT set and recalculated using the sCT images. The isocenter dose and dose-volume parameters were compared for 3D-CRT and VMAT plans respectively. The equivalent path length was also compared. The mean MAEs for the whole body soft tissue and bone region were 108.1\xa0\xa024.0 38.9\xa0\xa010.7 and 366.2\xa0\xa062.0 hounsfield unit respectively. The dosimetric evaluation revealed no significant difference in the isocenter dose for 3D-CRT plans. The differences in the dose received by 2% of the volume D2% D50% and D98% relative to the prescribed dose were\xa0<1.0%. The overall equivalent path length was shorter than that for real CT by 0.6\xa0\xa01.9\xa0mm. A treatment planning study using generated sCT detected only small clinically negligible differences. These findings demonstrated the feasibility of generating sCT images for MR-only radiotherapy from multi-sequence MR images using cGAN.
