Deep convolutional neural networks offer state-of-the-art performance for medical image analysis. However their architectures are manually designed for particular problems. On the one hand a manual designing process requires many trials to tune a large number of hyperparameters and\xa0is thus quite a time-consuming task. On the other hand the fittest hyperparameters that can adapt to source data properties e.g. sparsity noisy features are not able to be quickly identified for target data properties. For instance the realistic noise in medical images is usually mixed and complicated and sometimes unknown leading to challenges in applying existing methods directly and creating effective denoising neural networks easily. In this paper we present a Genetic Algorithm GA-based network evolution approach to search for the fittest genes to optimize network structures automatically. We expedite the evolutionary process through an experience-based greedy exploration strategy and transfer learning. Our evolutionary algorithm procedure has flexibility which allows taking advantage of current state-of-the-art modules e.g. residual blocks to search for promising neural networks. We evaluate our framework on a classic medical image analysis task: denoising. The experimental results on computed tomography perfusion CTP image denoising demonstrate the capability of the method to select the fittest genes for building high-performance networks named EvoNets. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods consistently at various noise levels. Deep Evolutionary Networks with Expedited Genetic Algorithms for Medical Image Denoising.
