Neuroimaging research has implicated abnormalities in cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical CSTC circuitry in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. In this study resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI was used to investigate functional connectivity in the CSTC circuitry in adolescents with OCD. Imaging was obtained with the Human Connectome Project HCP scanner using newly developed pulse sequences which allow for higher spatial and temporal resolution. Fifteen adolescents with OCD and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls ages 12-19 underwent R-fMRI on the 3T HCP scanner. Twenty-four minutes of resting-state scans two consecutive 12-min scans were acquired. We investigated functional connectivity of the striatum using a seed-based whole brain approach with anatomically-defined seeds placed in the bilateral caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens. Adolescents with OCD compared with controls exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the left putamen and a single cluster of right-sided cortical areas including parts of the orbitofrontal cortex inferior frontal gyrus insula and operculum. Preliminary findings suggest that impaired striatal connectivity in adolescents with OCD in part falls within the predicted CSTC network and also involves impaired connections between a key CSTC network region i.e. putamen and key regions in the salience network i.e. insula/operculum. The relevance of impaired putamen-insula/operculum connectivity in OCD is discussed. Abnormal striatal resting-state functional connectivity in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
