Deep learning techniques have been extensively used in computerized pulmonary nodule analysis in recent years. Many reported studies still utilized hybrid methods for diagnosis in which convolutional neural networks CNNs are used only as one part of the pipeline and the whole system still needs either traditional image processing modules or human intervention to obtain final results. In this paper we introduced a fast and fully-automated end-to-end system that can efficiently segment precise lung nodule contours from raw thoracic CT scans. Our proposed system has four major modules: candidate nodule detection with Faster regional-CNN R-CNN candidate merging false positive FP reduction with CNN and nodule segmentation with customized fully convolutional neural network FCN. The entire system has no human interaction or database specific design. The average runtime is about 16\u2009s per scan on a standard workstation. The nodule detection accuracy is 91.4% and 94.6% with an average of 1 and 4 false positives FPs per scan. The average dice coefficient of nodule segmentation compared to the groundtruth is 0.793. Fast and fully-automated detection and segmentation of pulmonary nodules in thoracic CT scans using deep convolutional neural networks.
