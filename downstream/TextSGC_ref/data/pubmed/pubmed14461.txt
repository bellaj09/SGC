Event related potentials ERPs were employed to investigate whether and when brain activity related to face recognition varies according to the processing level undertaken at encoding. Recognition was assessed when preceded by a "shallow" orientation judgement or by a "deep" study task occupation judgement. Moreover we included a further manipulation by presenting at encoding faces either in the upright or inverted orientation. As expected deeply encoded faces were recognized more accurately and more quickly with respect to shallowly encoded faces. The ERP showed three main findings: i as witnessed by more positive-going potentials for deeply encoded faces at early and later processing stage face recognition was influenced by the processing strategy adopted during encoding; ii structural encoding indexed by the N170 turned out to be "cognitively penetrable" showing repetition priming effects for deeply encoded faces; iii face inversion by disrupting configural processing during encoding influenced memory related processes for deeply encoded faces and impaired the recognition of faces shallowly processed. The present study adds weight to the concept that the depth of processing during memory encoding affects retrieval. We found that successful retrieval following deep encoding involved both familiarity- and recollection-related processes showing from 500 ms a fronto-parietal distribution whereas shallow encoding affected only earlier processing stages reflecting perceptual priming.
