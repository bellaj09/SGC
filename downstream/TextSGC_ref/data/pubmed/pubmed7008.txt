"Depression is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimers disease AD occurring in up to 40% of AD patients. It influences the cognitive function of patients and increases the burden on their caregivers. Currently there are few effective medical treatments for reducing the symptoms of depression in AD patients. Understanding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in AD patients with depression D-AD is crucial for developing effective interventions. The anterior cingulate cortex ACC is an important brain region involved in emotional and cognitive processing. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that patients with major depressive disorder have structural functional and metabolic abnormalities in the ACC."
