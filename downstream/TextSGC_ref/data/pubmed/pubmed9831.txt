"Early physiological studies emphasized changes in the discharge rate of basal ganglia in the pathophysiology of Parkinsons disease PD whereas recent studies stressed the role of the abnormal oscillatory activity and neuronal synchronization of pallidal cells. However human observations cast doubt on the synchronization hypothesis since increased synchronization may be an epi-phenomenon of the tremor or of independent oscillators with similar frequency. Here we show that modern actor/ critic models of the basal ganglia predict the emergence of synchronized activity in PD and that significant non-oscillatory and oscillatory correlations are found in MPTP primates. We conclude that the normal fluctuation of basal ganglia dopamine levels combined with local cortico-striatal learning rules lead to noncorrelated activity in the pallidum. Dopamine depletion as in PD results in correlated pallidal activity and reduced information capacity. We therefore suggest that future deep brain stimulation DBS algorithms may be improved by desynchronizing pallidal activity."
