"With the continuous development of the convolutional neural network CNN concept and other deep learning technologies target recognition in Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR images has entered a new stage. At present shallow CNNs with simple structure are mostly applied in SAR image target recognition even though their feature extraction ability is limited to a large extent. Whats more research on improving SAR image target recognition efficiency and imbalanced data processing is relatively scarce. Thus a lightweight CNN model for target recognition in SAR image is designed in this paper. First based on visual attention mechanism the channel attention by-pass and spatial attention by-pass are introduced to the network to enhance the feature extraction ability. Then the depthwise separable convolution is used to replace the standard convolution to reduce the computation cost and heighten the recognition efficiency. Finally a new weighted distance measure loss function is introduced to weaken the adverse effect of data imbalance on the recognition accuracy of minority class. A series of recognition experiments based on two open data sets of MSTAR and OpenSARShip are implemented. Experimental results show that compared with four advanced networks recently proposed our network can greatly diminish the model size and iteration time while guaranteeing the recognition accuracy and it can effectively alleviate the adverse effects of data imbalance on recognition results."
