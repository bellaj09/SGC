Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment methods for nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC. It requires exact delineation of the nasopharynx gross tumor volume GTVnx the metastatic lymph node gross tumor volume GTVnd the clinical target volume CTV and organs at risk in the planning computed tomography images. However this task is time-consuming and operator dependent. In the present study we developed an end-to-end deep deconvolutional neural network DDNN for segmentation of these targets. Deep Deconvolutional Neural Network for Target Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Cancer in Planning Computed Tomography Images.
