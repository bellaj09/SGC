In this paper we propose a novel machine learning ML based link-to-system L2S mapping technique for inter-connecting a link-level simulator LLS and a system-level simulator SLS. For validating the proposed technique we utilized 5G K-Simulator which was developed through a collaborative research project in Republic of Korea and includes LLS SLS and network-level simulator NS. We first describe a general procedure of the L2S mapping methodology for 5G new radio NR systems and then we explain the proposed ML-based exponential effective signal-to-noise ratio SNR mapping EESM method with a deep neural network DNN regression algorithm. We compared the proposed ML-based EESM method with the conventional L2S mapping method. Through extensive simulation results we show that the proposed ML-based L2S mapping technique yielded better prediction accuracy in regards to block error rate BLER while reducing the processing time.
