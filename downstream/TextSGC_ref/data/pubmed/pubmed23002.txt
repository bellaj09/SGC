Brain-computer interfaces BCIs might restore communication to people severely disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or other disorders. We sought to: 1 define a protocol for determining whether a person with ALS can use a visual P300-based BCI; 2 determine what proportion of this population can use the BCI; and 3 identify factors affecting BCI performance. Twenty-five individuals with ALS completed an evaluation protocol using a standard 6  6 matrix and parameters selected by stepwise linear discrimination. With an 8-channel EEG montage the subjects fell into two groups in BCI accuracy chance accuracy 3%. Seventeen averaged 92  3% range 71-100% which is adequate for communication G70 group. Eight averaged 12  6% range 0-36% inadequate for communication L40 subject group. Performance did not correlate with disability: 11/17 65% of G70 subjects were severely disabled i.e. ALSFRS-R < 5. All L40 subjects had visual impairments e.g. nystagmus diplopia ptosis. P300 was larger and more anterior in G70 subjects. A 16-channel montage did not significantly improve accuracy. In conclusion most people severely disabled by ALS could use a visual P300-based BCI for communication. In those who could not visual impairment was the principal obstacle. For these individuals auditory P300-based BCIs might be effective. Brain-computer interface BCI evaluation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
