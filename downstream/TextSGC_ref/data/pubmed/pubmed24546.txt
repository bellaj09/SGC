Ethical concerns for surgical training on patients limited working hours with fewer cases per trainee and the potential to better select talented persons for arthroscopic surgery raise the interest in simulator training for arthroscopic surgery. It was the purpose of this study to analyze learning curves of novices using a knee arthroscopy simulator and to correlate their performance with potentially predictive factors. Performance of medical students on a virtual reality simulator for knee arthroscopy: an analysis of learning curves and predictors of performance.
