Learning good representation for images is always a hot topic in machine learning and pattern recognition fields. Among the numerous algorithms dictionary learning is a well-known strategy for effective feature extraction. Recently more discriminative sub-dictionaries have been built by Fisher discriminative dictionary learning with specific class labels. Different types of constraints such as sparsity low rankness and locality are also exploited to make use of global and local information. On the other hand as the basic building block of deep structure the auto-encoder has demonstrated its promising performance in extracting new feature representation. To this end we develop a unified feature learning framework by incorporating the marginalized denoising auto-encoder into a locality-constrained dictionary learning scheme named marginalized denoising dictionary learning. Overall we deploy low-rank constraint on each sub-dictionary and locality constraint instead of sparsity on coefficients in order to learn a more concise and pure feature spaces meanwhile inheriting the discrimination from sub-dictionary learning. Finally we evaluate our algorithm on several face and object data sets. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods.
