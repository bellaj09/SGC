"We present a multi-task learning-based convolutional neural network MTL-CNN able to estimate multiple tags describing face images simultaneously. In total the model is able to estimate up to 74 different face attributes belonging to three distinct recognition tasks: age group gender and visual attributes such as hair color face shape and the presence of makeup. The proposed model shares all the CNNs parameters among tasks and deals with task-specific estimation through the introduction of two components: i a gating mechanism to control activations sharing and to adaptively route them across different face attributes; ii a module to post-process the predictions in order to take into account the correlation among face attributes. The model is trained by fusing multiple databases for increasing the number of face attributes that can be estimated and using a center loss for disentangling representations among face attributes in the embedding space. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach." Fine-Grained Face Annotation Using Deep Multi-Task CNN.
