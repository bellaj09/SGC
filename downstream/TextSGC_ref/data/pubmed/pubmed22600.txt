Virtual Reality is becoming widespread in our society within very different areas from industry to entertainment. It has many advantages in education as well since it allows visualizing almost any object or going anywhere in a unique way. We will be focusing on medical education and more specifically anatomy where its use is especially interesting because it allows studying any structure of the human body by placing the user inside each one. By allowing virtual immersion in a body structure such as the interior of the cranium stereoscopic vision goggles make these innovative teaching technologies a powerful tool for training in all areas of health sciences. The aim of this study is to illustrate the teaching potential of applying Virtual Reality in the field of human anatomy where it can be used as a tool for education in medicine. A Virtual Reality Software was developed as an educational tool. This technological procedure is based entirely on software which will run in stereoscopic goggles to give users the sensation of being in a virtual environment clearly showing the different bones and foramina which make up the cranium and accompanied by audio explanations. Throughout the results the structure of the cranium is described in detailed from both inside and out. Importance of an exhaustive morphological knowledge of cranial fossae is further discussed. Application for the design of microsurgery is also commented. Virtual Reality Educational Tool for Human Anatomy.
