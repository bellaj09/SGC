Robot-assisted therapy has become a promising technology in the field of rehabilitation for poststroke patients with motor disorders. Motivation during the rehabilitation process is a top priority for most stroke survivors. With current advancements in technology there has been the introduction of virtual reality VR augmented reality AR customizable games or a combination thereof that aid robotic therapy in retaining or increasing the interests of patients so they keep performing their exercises. However there are gaps in the evidence regarding the transition from clinical rehabilitation to home-based therapy which calls for an updated synthesis of the literature that showcases this trend. The present review proposes a categorization of these studies according to technologies used and details research in both upper limb and lower limb applications.
