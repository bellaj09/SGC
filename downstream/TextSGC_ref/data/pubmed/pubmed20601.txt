When we touch something with a tool we feel the touch at the tip of the tool rather than at the hand. Yamamoto and Kitazawa Yamamoto S. Kitazawa S. 2001b. Sensation at the tips of invisible tools. Nat. Neurosci. 4 979-980 previously showed that the judgment of the temporal order of two successive stimuli delivered to the tips of sticks held in each hand was dramatically altered by crossing the sticks without changing the positions of the hands. This provided evidence for the referral of tactile signals to the tip of a tool in hand. In this study we examined importance of force feedback from the tool in the referral by manipulating the direction of force feedback in a virtual reality. The virtual tool consisted of a spherical action point that was moved with a stylus in hand. Subjects held two styli one in each hand put each action point on each of two buttons in the virtual reality and were required to judge the order of successive taps delivered to the two styli. We manipulated the direction of reaction force from each button so that it was congruent or incongruent to the visual configuration of the button. When the arms were uncrossed judgment primarily depended on whether the action points were crossed or not in the visual space. But when the arms were crossed judgment critically depended on the direction of force feedback. The results show that tactile signals can be referred to the action point in the virtual reality and that the force feedback becomes a critical factor when the arms are crossed. Referral of tactile stimuli to action points in virtual reality with reaction force.
