Traumatic brain injury TBI is a common event in the current extended conflicts by American service members with estimates that as many as 300000 have sustained combat-related concussions during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The limited ecological validity of traditional neuropsychological assessment measures presents a challenge to effective postconcussion evaluation of service members in relation to fitness-for-duty decisions or rehabilitation needs. Virtual reality VR technology offers a promising opportunity to advance the field of functional assessment for TBI. This article reviews the current professional literature on VR applications for TBI assessment with special emphasis on those that are particularly relevant to U.S. service members. VR affords several advantages for clinical use. These include assessment of complex sets of cognitive and behavioral functions rather than the isolated components assessed by traditional measures; more precise control over the standardized presentation of task stimuli and the recording of response data; and enhanced ecological validity that can lead to more useful assessment data in the applied contexts faced by the U.S. military.
