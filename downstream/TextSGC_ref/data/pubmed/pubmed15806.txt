Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental illness that poses significant challenges. While many pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are available many treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients continue to suffer from persistent psychotic symptoms notably auditory verbal hallucinations AVH which are highly disabling. This unmet clinical need requires new innovative treatment options. Recently a psychological therapy using computerized technology has shown large therapeutic effects on AVH severity by enabling patients to engage in a dialogue with a computerized representation of their voices. These very promising results have been extended by our team using immersive virtual reality VR. Our study was a 7-week phase-II randomized partial cross-over trial. Nineteen schizophrenia patients with refractory AVH were recruited and randomly allocated to either VR-assisted therapy VRT or treatment-as-usual TAU. The group allocated to TAU consisted of antipsychotic treatment and usual meetings with clinicians. The TAU group then received a delayed 7weeks of VRT. A follow-up was ensured 3months after the last VRT therapy session. Changes in psychiatric symptoms before and after TAU or VRT were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Our findings showed that VRT produced significant improvements in AVH severity depressive symptoms and quality of life that lasted at the 3-month follow-up period. Consistent with previous research our results suggest that VRT might be efficacious in reducing AVH related distress. The therapeutic effects of VRT on the distress associated with the voices were particularly prominent d=1.2. VRT is a highly novel and promising intervention for refractory AVH in schizophrenia.
