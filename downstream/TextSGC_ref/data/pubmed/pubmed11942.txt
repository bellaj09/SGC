In radiation therapy a key step for a successful cancer treatment is image-based treatment planning. One objective of the planning phase is the fast and accurate segmentation of organs at risk and target structures from medical images. However manual delineation of organs which is still the gold standard in many clinical environments is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variations. Consequently many automated segmentation methods have been developed. Multi-organ segmentation of the head and neck area: an efficient hierarchical neural networks approach.
