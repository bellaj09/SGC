High-risk neuroblastoma is a very aggressive disease with excessive tumor growth and poor outcomes. A proper stratification of the high-risk patients by prognostic outcome is important for treatment. However there is still a lack of survival stratification for the high-risk neuroblastoma. To fill the gap we adopt a deep learning algorithm Autoencoder to integrate multi-omics data and combine it with K-means clustering to identify two subtypes with significant survival differences. By comparing the Autoencoder with PCA iCluster and DGscore about the classification based on multi-omics data integration Autoencoder-based classification outperforms the alternative approaches. Furthermore we also validated the classification in two independent datasets by training machine-learning classification models and confirmed its robustness. Functional analysis revealed that MYCN amplification was more frequently occurred in the ultra-high-risk subtype in accordance with the overexpression of MYC/MYCN targets in this subtype. In summary prognostic subtypes identified by deep learning-based multi-omics integration could not only improve our understanding of molecular mechanism but also help the clinicians make decisions.
