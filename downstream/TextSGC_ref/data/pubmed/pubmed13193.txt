In this paper we present two models for automatically extracting red blood cells RBCs from RBCs holographic images based on a deep learning fully convolutional neural network FCN algorithm. The first model called FCN-1 only uses the FCN algorithm to carry out RBCs prediction whereas the second model called FCN-2 combines the FCN approach with the marker-controlled watershed transform segmentation scheme to achieve RBCs extraction. Both models achieve good segmentation accuracy. In addition the second model has much better performance in terms of cell separation than traditional segmentation methods. In the proposed methods the RBCs phase images are first numerically reconstructed from RBCs holograms recorded with off-axis digital holographic microscopy. Then some RBCs phase images are manually segmented and used as training data to fine-tune the FCN. Finally each pixel in new input RBCs phase images is predicted into either foreground or background using the trained FCN models. The RBCs prediction result from the first model is the final segmentation result whereas the result from the second model is used as the internal markers of the marker-controlled transform algorithm for further segmentation. Experimental results show that the given schemes can automatically extract RBCs from RBCs phase images and much better RBCs separation results are obtained when the FCN technique is combined with the marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm.
