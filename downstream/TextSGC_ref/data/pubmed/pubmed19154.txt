Phantom motor execution PME facilitated by augmented/virtual reality AR/VR and serious gaming SG has been proposed as a treatment for phantom limb pain PLP. Evidence of the efficacy of this approach was obtained through a clinical trial involving individuals with chronic intractable PLP affecting the upper limb and further evidence is currently being sought with a multi-sited international double blind randomized controlled clinical trial in upper and lower limb amputees. All experiments have been conducted in a clinical setting supervised by a therapist. Here we present a series of case studies two upper and two lower limb amputees on the use of PME as a self-treatment. We explore the benefits and the challenges encountered in translation from clinic to home use with a holistic mixed-methods approach employing both quantitative and qualitative methods from engineering medical anthropology and user interface design.
