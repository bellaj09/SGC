The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs in differentiating subtle intermediate and more obvious image differences in radiography. Three different datasets were created which included presence/absence of the endotracheal ET tube n\xa0=\xa0300 low/normal position of the ET tube n\xa0=\xa0300 and chest/abdominal radiographs n\xa0=\xa0120. The datasets were split into training validation and test. Both untrained and pre-trained deep neural networks were employed including AlexNet and GoogLeNet classifiers using the Caffe framework. Data augmentation was performed for the presence/absence and low/normal ET tube datasets. Receiver operating characteristic ROC area under the curves AUC and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Statistical differences of the AUCs were determined using a non-parametric approach. The pre-trained AlexNet and GoogLeNet classifiers had perfect accuracy AUC 1.00 in differentiating chest vs. abdominal radiographs using only 45 training cases. For more difficult datasets including the presence/absence and low/normal position endotracheal tubes more training cases pre-trained networks and data-augmentation approaches were helpful to increase accuracy. The best-performing network for classifying presence vs. absence of an ET tube was still very accurate with an AUC of 0.99. However for the most difficult dataset such as low vs. normal position of the endotracheal tube DCNNs did not perform as well but achieved a reasonable AUC of 0.81.
