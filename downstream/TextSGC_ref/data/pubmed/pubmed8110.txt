Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds plays a vital role in autonomous driving 3D maps and smart cities etc. Recent work such as PointSIFT shows that spatial structure information can improve the performance of semantic segmentation. Motivated by this phenomenon we propose Spatial Aggregation Net SAN for point cloud semantic segmentation. SAN is based on multi-directional convolution scheme that utilizes the spatial structure information of point cloud. Firstly Octant-Search is employed to capture the neighboring points around each sampled point. Secondly we use multi-directional convolution to extract information from different directions of sampled points. Finally max-pooling is used to aggregate information from different directions. The experimental results conducted on ScanNet database show that the proposed SAN has comparable results with state-of-the-art algorithms such as PointNet PointNet++ and PointSIFT etc. In particular our method has better performance on flat small objects and the edge areas that connect objects. Moreover our model has good trade-off in segmentation accuracy and time complexity. Spatial Aggregation Net: Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Based on Multi-Directional Convolution.
