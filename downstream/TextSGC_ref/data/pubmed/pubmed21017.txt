For people suffering from severe paralysis communication can be difficult or nearly impossible. Technology systems called brain-computer interfaces BCIs are being developed to assist these people with communication by using their brain activity to control a computer without any muscle activity. To benefit the development of BCIs that employ neural activity related to speech we investigated if neural activity patterns related to different articulator movements can be distinguished from each other. We recorded with electrocorticography ECoG the neural activity related to different articulator movements in 4 epilepsy patients and classified which articulator participants moved based on the sensorimotor cortex activity patterns. The same was done for different movement directions of a single articulator the tongue. In both experiments highly accurate classification was obtained on average 92% for different articulators and 85% for different tongue directions. Furthermore the data show that only a small part of the sensorimotor cortex is needed for classification ca. 1\u2009cm2. We show that recordings from small parts of the sensorimotor cortex contain information about different articulator movements which might be used for BCI control. Our results are of interest for BCI systems that aim to decode neural activity related to actual or attempted movements from a contained cortical area. Classification of Articulator Movements and Movement Direction from Sensorimotor Cortex Activity.
