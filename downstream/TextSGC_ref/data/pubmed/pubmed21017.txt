Technologies such as videos toys and video games are used as tools in delivering education to young children. Do children spontaneously transfer between virtual and real-world mediums as they learn? Fifty-six children learned facts about a toy dog presented through varying levels of technology and interactivity e.g. video game stuffed animal picture books. They then met a similar dog character in a new embodiment e.g. as a stuffed animal if first met the dog as video character. Would children spontaneously generalize the facts they learned about the dog character across mediums dynamic and static environments? Results indicate that younger children were more likely to generalize facts across mediums. Specific aspects of the level of technology and interactivity had little effect. Effects of age on associating virtual and embodied toys.
