"In view of the problem that there is no standard diagnosis for early stage keratoconus diseaseat the same time to assist the special examiner and ophthalmologist to make the early diagnosis effectivelythe advantages and disadvantages of each testing instrument were analyzed.In order to construct an assistant system for early diagnosis of keratoconusa deep learning technique was applied in corneal OCT examination.The system used improved VGG-16 to realize the recognition accuracy of about 68% keratoconus keratopathyand the clinical results showed that the system can help doctors to give diagnosis confidence to a certain extent.At the same timethe physicians re-marking of OCT can help train the system for more accurate judgment." Application of Deep Learning in Early Diagnosis Assistant System of Keratoconus.
