Two of the hurdles that are facing ophthalmologists in developing countries are scarcity of resources and patient follow-up. Deep sclerectomy DS has proven less costly and more effective than topical therapies and has a more favorable safety profile than trabeculectomy. The main factors preventing its use in developing countries are the need to perform laser goniopuncture in 40-80% of cases to maintain filtration and the risk of postoperative iris incarceration. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety profile in advanced open-angle glaucoma of a relatively new surgical technique designed to overcome this limitation: penetrating DS. Prospective evaluation of penetrating deep sclerectomy in advanced open-angle glaucoma: Filtration surgery adapted to resource scarcity in developing countries.
