Signal classification is a key of brain-computer interfaceBCI.In this paperwe present a new method for classifying the electroencephalogramEEGsignals of which the features are heterogeneous.This method is called wrapped elastic net feature selection and classification.Firstlywe used the joint application of time-domain statisticpower spectral densityPSDcommon spatial patternCSPand autoregressiveARmodel to extract high-dimensional fused features of the preprocessed EEG signals.Then we used the wrapped method for feature selection.We fitted the logistic regression model penalized with elastic net on the training dataand obtained the parameter estimation by coordinate descent method.Then we selected best feature subset by using 10-fold cross-validation.Finallywe classified the test sample using the trained model.Data used in the experiment were the EEG data from international BCI Competition.The results showed that the method proposed was suitable for fused feature selection with high-dimension.For identifying EEG signalsit is more effective and fasterand can single out a more relevant subset to obtain a relatively simple model.The average test accuracy reached 81.78%.
