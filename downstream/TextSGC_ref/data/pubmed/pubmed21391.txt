The fast estimation of blue-green laser transmission characteristics through the fluctuating sea surface such as refraction angles and transmittance is very important to correct operating parameters detection depth and anti-detection warning in airborne Light Detection and Ranging LiDAR applications. However the geometry of the sea surface is changed by complex environment factors such as wind and wave which significantly affect the rapid acquisition of the blue-green laser transmission characteristics. To address this problem a fast analysis method is provided to rapidly compute the blue-green laser transmittance and refraction angles through the fluctuating sea surface driven by different wind directions and speeds. In the method a three-dimensional wave model driven by the wind was built to describe the wave spatial distribution varying with time. Using the wave model the propagation path of the scanning laser footprint was analyzed using the proposed meshing method thus the transmittance and refraction angles of the optical path can be fast obtained by using parallel computing. The simulation results imply that the proposed method can reduce the time consumption by 70% compared with the traditional analytical method with sequential computing. This paper provides some statistical laws of refraction angles and transmittance through the fluctuating sea surface under different wind conditions which may serve as a basic for fast computation of airborne LiDAR transmission characteristics in complex environments.
