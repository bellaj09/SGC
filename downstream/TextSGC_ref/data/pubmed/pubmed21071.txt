Camera handling and navigation are essential skills in laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons rely on camera operators usually the least experienced members of the team for visualization of the operative field. Essential skills for camera operators include maintaining orientation an effective horizon appropriate zoom control and a clean lens. Virtual reality VR simulation may be a useful adjunct to developing camera skills in a novice population. No standardized VR-based camera navigation curriculum is currently available. We developed and implemented a novel curriculum on the LapSim VR simulator platform for our residents and students. We hypothesize that our curriculum will demonstrate construct and face validity in our trainee population distinguishing levels of laparoscopic experience as part of a realistic training curriculum. Construct and face validity of a virtual reality-based camera navigation curriculum.
