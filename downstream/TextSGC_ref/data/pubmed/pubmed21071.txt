In Brain-Computer Interface BCI ResearchElectroencephalography EEG has obtained great attention for biomedical applications. In BCI system feature representation and classification are important tasks as the accuracy of classification highly depends on these stages. In this paper we propose a model in which Common Spatial Pattern CSP is used to discriminate inter-class data using co-variance maximization and Fast Fourier Transform Energy Map FFTEM is used for feature selection and mapping of 1D data into 2D data energy maps. Convolutional Neural Network is used for classification of multi-class Motor Imagery MI signals. Further this paper investigates near-optimal parameter selection for feature mapping frequency bands selection and temporal segmentation. It is shown that our proposed method outperformed the reported methods by achieving 0.61 mean kappa value. DeepMI: Deep Learning for Multiclass Motor Imagery Classification.
