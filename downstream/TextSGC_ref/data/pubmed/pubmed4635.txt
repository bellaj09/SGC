Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI has been used to examine the brain mechanisms of stroke patients with hemiplegia but the relationship between functional connectivity FC and treatment-induced motor function recovery has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to identify the brain FC changes in stroke patients and study the relationship between FC and motor function assessment using the resting-state fMRI. Relationship between functional connectivity and motor function assessment in stroke patients with hemiplegia: a resting-state functional MRI study.
