Miniaturization of implantable devices is an important challenge for future brain-computer interface applications and in particular for achieving precise neuron stimulation. For stimulation that utilizes light i.e. optogenetics the light propagation behavior and interaction at the nanoscale with elements within the neuron is an important factor that needs to be considered when designing the device. This paper analyzes the effect of light behavior for a single neuron stimulation and focuses on the impact from different cell shapes. Based on the Mie scattering theory the paper analyzes how the shape of the soma and the nucleus contributes to the focusing effect resulting in an intensity increase which ensures that neurons can assist in transferring light through the tissue toward the target cells. At the same time this intensity increase can in turn also stimulate neighboring cells leading to interference within the neural circuits. This paper also analyzes the ideal placements of the device with respect to the angle and position within the cortex that can enable axonal biophoton communications which can contain light within the cell to avoid the interference.
