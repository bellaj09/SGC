Intracranial endoscopy as minimal invasive surgery for the treatment of hydrocephalus and intracranial cysts cannot be disregarded after 10 years of clinical practicing. The advantages are low traumatization of brain tissue and good visual control of the operation field. Neuronavigation qualifies as a method of increased operation safety for lesions which are deep seated or difficult to access. A combination of both systems partially neutralizes the respective disadvantages. On the one hand the neuronavigation ensures the endoscopic approach up to the intracranial caverns and especially supports the endoscopy in cases of bad vision or pathologic anatomy. Endoscopy on the other hand enables the surgeon to recognize discrepancies and mistakes of the neuronavigation due to optical control. Increased expenses and time and staff requirements are counterbalanced by the increased cumulated operation safety. An advantageous side-effect of the combination of neuronavigation and intracranial endoscopy is the high learning potential for assistants. For all these reasons the application of neuronavigation in intracranial endoscopy is considered very important and strongly recommended.
