\u3000During the preclinical research period of drug development animal testing is widely used to help screen out a drug\s dangerous side effects. However it remains difficult to predict side effects within the central nervous system. Here we introduce a machine learning-based in vitro system designed to detect seizure-inducing side effects before clinical trial. We recorded local field potentials from the CA1 alveus in acute mouse neocortico-hippocampal slices that were bath-perfused with each of 14 different drugs and at 5 different concentrations of each drug. For each of these experimental conditions we collected seizure-like neuronal activity and merged their waveforms as one graphic image which was further converted into a feature vector using Caffe an open framework for deep learning. In the space of the first two principal components the support vector machine completely separated the vectors i.e. doses of individual drugs that induced seizure-like events and identified diphenhydramine enoxacin strychnine and theophylline as "seizure-inducing" drugs which have indeed been reported to induce seizures in clinical situations. Thus this artificial intelligence-based classification may provide a new platform to pre-clinically detect seizure-inducing side effects of drugs. Machine Learning-based Prediction of Seizure-inducing Action as an Adverse Drug Effect.
