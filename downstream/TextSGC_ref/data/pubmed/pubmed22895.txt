Multigrid algorithms are gaining popularity in virtual reality simulations as they have a theoretically optimal performance that scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the simulation system. We propose a multilevel approach that combines the efficiency of the multigrid algorithms with the ability to resolve multi-body constraints during interactive simulations. First we develop a single level modified block Gauss-Seidel MBGS smoother that can incorporate constraints. This is subsequently incorporated in a standard multigrid V-cycle with corrections for constraints to form the modified multigrid V-cycle MMgV. Numerical results show that the solver can resolve constraints while achieving the theoretical performance of multigrid schemes. A modified multilevel scheme for internal and external constraints in virtual environments.
