Any occupation which involves critical decision making in real-time requires attention and concentration. When repetitive and expanded working periods are encountered it can result in microsleeps. Microsleeps are complete lapses in which a subject involuntarily stops responding to the task that they are currently performing due to temporary interruptions in visual-motor and cognitive coordination. Microsleeps can last up to 15 s while performing a particular task. In this study the ability of a convolutional neural network CNN to detect microsleep states from 16-channel EEG data from 8 subjects performing a 1D visuomotor was explored. The data were highly imbalanced. When averaged across 8 subjects there were 17 responsive states for every microsleep state. Two approaches were used to handle the CNN training with data imbalance - oversampling the minority class and cost-based learning. The EEG was analysed using a 4-s epoch with a step size of 0.25 s. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance. The performance measures used for assessing the detection capability of the CNN were: sensitivity precision phi geometric mean GM AUCROC and AUCPR. The performance measures obtained using the oversampling and cost-based learning methods were: AUCROC = 0.90/0.90 AUCPR = 0.41/0.41 and a phi = 0.42/0.40 respectively. Although the performances were similar the cost-based learning method had a considerably shorter training time than the oversampling method.
