Long-term potentiation LTP is the key cellular mechanism for physiological learning and pathological chronic pain. In the anterior cingulate cortex ACC postsynaptic recruitment or modification of AMPA receptor AMPAR GluA1 contribute to the expression of LTP. Here we report that pyramidal cells in the deep layers of the ACC send direct descending projecting terminals to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord lamina I-III. After peripheral nerve injury these projection cells are activated and postsynaptic excitatory responses of these descending projecting neurons were significantly enhanced. Newly recruited AMPARs contribute to the potentiated synaptic transmission of cingulate neurons. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluA1 is important since enhanced synaptic transmission was abolished in GluA1 phosphorylation site serine-845 mutant mice. Our findings provide strong evidence that peripheral nerve injury induce long-term enhancement of cortical-spinal projecting cells in the ACC. Direct top-down projection system provides rapid and profound modulation of spinal sensory transmission including painful information. Inhibiting cortical top-down descending facilitation may serve as a novel target for treating neuropathic pain.
