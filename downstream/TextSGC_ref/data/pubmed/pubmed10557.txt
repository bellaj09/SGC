Experimental evidence recently indicated that neural networks can learn in a different manner than was previously assumed using adaptive nodes instead of adaptive links. Consequently links to a node undergo the same adaptation resulting in cooperative nonlinear dynamics with oscillating effective link weights. Here we show that the biological reality of stationary log-normal distribution of effective link weights in neural networks is a result of such adaptive nodes although each effective link weight varies significantly in time. The underlying mechanism is a stochastic restoring force emerging from a spontaneous temporal ordering of spike pairs generated by strong effective link preceding by a weak one. In addition for feedforward adaptive node networks the number of dynamical attractors can scale exponentially with the number of links. These results are expected to advance deep learning capabilities and to open horizons to an interplay between adaptive node rules and the distribution of network link weights. Stationary log-normal distribution of weights stems from spontaneous ordering in adaptive node networks.
