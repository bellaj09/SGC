Suicide risk assessment is variably taught and learnt by health professionals. The literature indicates that training programs of this fundamental competency need to be enhanced. To facilitate teaching and learning of this core clinical skill we propose a novel visual metaphor in order to conceptualize suicide risk factors. The design of the proposed visual metaphor was informed by the Cognitive Load Theory to enhance deep learning of the various suicide risk factors. Enhancing suicide risk assessment: a novel visual metaphor learning tool.
