"In the CellSearch system blood is immunomagnetically enriched for epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM expression and cells are stained with the nucleic acid dye 46-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI Cytokeratin-PE CK and CD45-APC. Only DAPI+/CK+ objects are presented to the operator to identify circulating tumor cells CTC and the identity of all other cells and potential undetected CTC remains unrevealed. Here we used the open source imaging program Automatic CTC Classification Enumeration and PhenoTyping ACCEPT to analyze all DAPI+ nuclei in EpCAM-enriched blood samples obtained from 192 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC patients and 162 controls. Significantly larger numbers of nuclei were detected in 300 patient samples with an average and standard deviation of 73570  74948 as compared to 359 control samples with an average and standard deviation of 4191  4463 p < 0.001. In patients only 18%  21% and in controls 23%  15% of the nuclei were identified as leukocytes or CTC. Adding CD16-PerCP for granulocyte staining the use of an LED as the light source for CD45-APC excitation and plasma membrane staining obtained with wheat germ agglutinin significantly improved the classification of EpCAM-enriched cells resulting in the identification of 94%  5% of the cells. However especially in patients the origin of the unidentified cells remains unknown. Further studies are needed to determine if undetected EpCAM+/DAPI+/CK-/CD45- CTC is present among these cells."
