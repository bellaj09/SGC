The benefit of deep brain stimulation DBS for Parkinson disease PD may depend on connectivity between the stimulation site and other brain regions but which regions and whether connectivity can predict outcome in patients remain unknown. Here we identify the structural and functional connectivity profile of effective DBS to the subthalamic nucleus STN and test its ability to predict outcome in an independent cohort. Connectivity Predicts deep brain stimulation outcome in Parkinson disease.
