Brain extraction is a critical preprocessing step in the analysis of neuroimaging studies conducted with magnetic resonance imaging MRI and influences the accuracy of downstream analyses. The majority of brain extraction algorithms are however optimized for processing healthy brains and thus frequently fail in the presence of pathologically altered brain or when applied to heterogeneous MRI datasets. Here we introduce a new rigorously validated algorithm termed HD-BET relying on artificial neural networks that aim to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that HD-BET outperforms six popular publicly available brain extraction algorithms in several large-scale neuroimaging datasets including one from a prospective multicentric trial in neuro-oncology yielding state-of-the-art performance with median improvements of +1.16 to +2.50 points for the Dice coefficient and -0.66 to -2.51\u2009mm for the Hausdorff distance. Importantly the HD-BET algorithm which shows robust performance in the presence of pathology or treatment-induced tissue alterations is applicable to a broad range of MRI sequence types and is not influenced by variations in MRI hardware and acquisition parameters encountered in both research and clinical practice. For broader accessibility the HD-BET prediction algorithm is made freely available www.neuroAI-HD.org and may become an essential component for robust automated high-throughput processing of MRI neuroimaging data.
