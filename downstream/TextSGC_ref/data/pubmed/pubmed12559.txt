K-complexes KCs are a recognized EEG marker of sensory-processing and a defining feature of sleep stage 2. KC frequency and morphology may also be reflective of sleep quality aging and a range of sleep and sensory processing deficits. However manual scoring of K-complexes is impractical time-consuming and thus costly and currently not well-standardized. Although automated KC detection methods have been developed performance and uptake remain limited. Beyond K-complex binary scoring during sleep: Probabilistic classification using deep learning.
