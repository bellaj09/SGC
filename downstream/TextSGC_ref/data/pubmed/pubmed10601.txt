With the goal to screen high-risk populations for oral cancer in low- and middle-income countries LMICs we have developed a low-cost portable easy to use smartphone-based intraoral dual-modality imaging platform. In this paper we present an image classification approach based on autofluorescence and white light images using deep learning methods. The information from the autofluorescence and white light image pair is extracted calculated and fused to feed the deep learning neural networks. We have investigated and compared the performance of different convolutional neural networks transfer learning and several regularization techniques for oral cancer classification. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning methods in classifying dual-modal images for oral cancer detection. Automatic classification of dual-modalilty smartphone-based oral dysplasia and malignancy images using deep learning.
