Impairment in social skills is one of the few criteria that all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia must meet. Successful social skills require the coordination of many abilities including social perception which involves the decoding and interpretation of social cues from others. In this study we examined the potential for virtual reality VR in social skill training. We attempted to determine if VR can be used to measure social skills and social perception and to determine which VR parameters are related to schizophrenic symptoms. Some of these results have clear clinical relevance while other observations need further study. The VR system appears to be useful in assessing the social perception of schizophrenics and normal people and could be more widely used in the future for social training and in the assessment of social problem-solving abilities assertiveness skills and general social skills. Characteristics of social perception assessed in schizophrenia using virtual reality.
