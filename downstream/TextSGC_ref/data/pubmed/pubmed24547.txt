Recent progress in the number of studies involving brain connectivity analysis of motor imagery MI tasks for brain-computer interface BCI systems has warranted the need for pre-processing methods. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of current source density CSD estimation from raw electroencephalogram EEG signals on the classification performance of scalp level brain connectivity feature based MI-BCI. In particular time-domain partial Granger causality PGC method was implemented on the raw EEG signals and CSD signals of a publicly available dataset for the estimation of brain connectivity features. Moreover pairwise binary classifications of four different MI tasks were performed in inter-session and intra-session conditions using a support vector machine classifier. The results showed that CSD provided a statistically significant increase of the AUC: 20.28% in the inter-session condition; 12.54% and 13.92% with session 01 and session 02 respectively in the intra-session condition. These results show that pre-processing of EEG signals is crucial for single-trial connectivity features based MI-BCI systems and CSD can enhance their overall performance. Current source density estimates improve the discriminability of scalp-level brain connectivity features related to motor-imagery tasks.
