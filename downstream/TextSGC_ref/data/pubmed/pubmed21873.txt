The aim of this study was to develop new strategies based on virtual reality that can provide additional information to clinicians for the rehabilitation assessment. Virtual reality system Toyra has been used to record kinematic information of 15 patients with cervical spinal cord injury SCI while performing evaluation sessions using the mentioned system. Positive correlation with a moderate and very strong association has been found between clinical scales and kinematic data considering only the subscales more closely related to the upper limb function. A set of metrics was defined combining these kinematic data to obtain parameters of reaching amplitude joint amplitude agility accuracy and repeatability during the evaluation sessions of the virtual reality system Toyra. Strong and moderate correlations have been also found between the metrics reaching and joint amplitude and the clinical scales. Kinematic metrics based on the virtual reality system Toyra as an assessment of the upper limb rehabilitation in people with spinal cord injury.
