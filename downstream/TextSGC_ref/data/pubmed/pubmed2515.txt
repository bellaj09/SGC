Major depressive disorder MDD is highly prevalent recurrent and associated with functional impairment morbidity and mortality. Herein we aimed to identify disruptions in functional connectomics among subjects with MDD by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI. Sixteen subjects with MDD and thirty health controls completed resting-state fMRI scans and clinical assessments e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS. We found higher amplitude of low frequency fluctuations ALFF bilaterally in the hippocampus and amygdala among MDD subjects when compared to healthy controls. Using graph theoretical analysis we found decreased clustering coefficient local efficiency and transitivity in the MDD patients. Our findings suggest a potential biomarker for differentiating individuals with MDD from individuals without MDD. Assessment of brain functional connectome alternations and correlation with depression and anxiety in major depressive disorders.
