Ultrasound images acquired during axillary nerve block procedures can be difficult to interpret. Highlighting the important structures such as nerves and blood vessels may be useful for the training of inexperienced users. A deep convolutional neural network is used to identify the musculocutaneous median ulnar and radial nerves as well as the blood vessels in ultrasound images. A dataset of 49 subjects is collected and used for training and evaluation of the neural network. Several image augmentations such as rotation elastic deformation shadows and horizontal flipping are tested. The neural network is evaluated using cross validation. The results showed that the blood vessels were the easiest to detect with a precision and recall above 0.8. Among the nerves the median and ulnar nerves were the easiest to detect with an F -score of 0.73 and 0.62 respectively. The radial nerve was the hardest to detect with an F -score of 0.39. Image augmentations proved effective increasing F -score by as much as 0.13. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the improvement from rotation shadow and elastic deformation augmentations were significant and the combination of all augmentations gave the best result. The results are promising; however there is more work to be done as the precision and recall are still too low. A larger dataset is most likely needed to improve accuracy in combination with anatomical and temporal models.
