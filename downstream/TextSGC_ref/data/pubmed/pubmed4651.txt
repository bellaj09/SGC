"The modular organization of brain networks has been widely investigated using graph theoretical approaches. Recently it has been demonstrated that graph partitioning methods based on the maximization of global fitness functions like Newmans Modularity suffer from a resolution limit as they fail to detect modules that are smaller than a scale determined by the size of the entire network. Here we explore the effects of this limitation on the study of brain connectivity networks. We demonstrate that the resolution limit prevents detection of important details of the brain modular structure thus hampering the ability to appreciate differences between networks and to assess the topological roles of nodes. We show that Surprise a recently proposed fitness function based on probability theory does not suffer from these limitations. Surprise maximization in brain co-activation and functional connectivity resting state networks reveals the presence of a rich structure of heterogeneously distributed modules and differences in networks partitions that are undetectable by resolution-limited methods. Moreover Surprise leads to a more accurate identification of the networks connector hubs the elements that integrate the brain modules into a cohesive structure."
