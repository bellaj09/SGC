Medical image segmentation plays an important role in many clinical applications such as disease diagnosis surgery planning and computer-assisted therapy. However it is a very challenging task due to variant images qualities complex shapes of objects and the existence of outliers. Recently researchers have presented deep learning methods to segment medical images. However these methods often use the high-level features of the convolutional neural network directly or the high-level features combined with the shallow features thus ignoring the role of the global context features for the segmentation task. Consequently they have limited capability on extensive medical segmentation tasks. The purpose of this work is to devise a neural network with global context feature information for accomplishing medical image segmentation of different tasks.
