"Hydrostatic balloon dilatation of upper gastrointestinal strictures is associated with a risk of perforation that varies with the underlying pathology and with the technique employed. We present a technique of trans-balloon visualisation of the stricture during dilatation TBVD that allows direct real-time observation of the effect of dilatation on the stricture facilitating early recognition of mucosal abruption thereby reducing the perforation rate."
