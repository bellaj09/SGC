Although the stroke volume SV estimation by arterial blood pressure has been widely used in clinical practice its accuracy is questionable especially during periods of hemodynamic instability. We aimed to create novel SV estimating model based on deep-learning DL method. A convolutional neural network was applied to estimate SV from arterial blood pressure waveform data recorded from liver transplantation LT surgeries. The model was trained using a gold standard referential SV measured via pulmonary artery thermodilution method. Merging a gold standard SV and corresponding 10.24 seconds of arterial blood pressure waveform as an input/output data set with 2-senconds of sliding overlap 484384 data sets from 34 LT surgeries were used for training and validation of DL model. The performance of DL model was evaluated by correlation and concordance analyses in another 491353 data sets from 31 LT surgeries. We also evaluated the performance of pre-existing commercialized model EV1000 and the performance results of DL model and EV1000 were compared. The DL model provided an acceptable performance throughout the surgery r = 0.813 concordance rate = 74.15%. During the reperfusion phase where the most severe hemodynamic instability occurred DL model showed superior correlation 0.861; 95% Confidence Interval CI 0.855-0.866 vs. 0.570; 95% CI 0.556-0.584 P < 0.001 and higher concordance rate 90.6% vs. 75.8% over EV1000. In conclusion the DL-based model was superior for estimating intraoperative SV and thus might guide physicians to precise intraoperative hemodynamic management. Moreover the DL model seems to be particularly promising because it outperformed EV1000 in circumstance of rapid hemodynamic changes where physicians need most help.
