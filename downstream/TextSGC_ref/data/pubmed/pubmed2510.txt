The brain undergoes functional dynamic changes at all times. Investigating functional dynamics has been recently verified to be helpful for detecting psychological conditions and powerful for analyzing disease-related abnormalities of the brain. This article aims to detect functional dynamics. Specifically we focus on how to effectively distinguish corresponding functional connectivity and change points from functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data. By combining Bayesian connectivity change point model BCCPM a modified genetic algorithm GA is presented to optimize the evolutionary procedure toward the most probable distributions of real change points in fMRI. We randomly initialize different binary indicator vectors to represent different distributions of change points. Each indicator vector represents an individual in GA and together they form an initial population. Then we calculate Bayesian posterior probability and use it as the fitness of each individual. Finally we evolve individuals of current generation toward the next higher fitness generation by a series of modified genetic operators. After several evolutionary procedures individuals in the final generation may have outstanding fitness and the one with highest fitness can represent the most likely change point distribution in the corresponding fMRI data. Furthermore the most probable change point distribution could be resolved. We test the optimized method for BCCPM on several synthesized data sets and the experimental results verify that the proposed model produces higher accuracy results with lower time consumption. Also we apply the new model to real block-designed task-based fMRI data set and excellent results are obtained. An Optimized Method for Bayesian Connectivity Change Point Model.
