The P300 speller is a brain-computer interface BCI that can possibly restore communication abilities to individuals with severe neuromuscular disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS by exploiting elicited brain signals in electroencephalography EEG data. However accurate spelling with BCIs is slow due to the need to average data over multiple trials to increase the signal-to-noise ratio SNR of the elicited brain signals. Probabilistic approaches to dynamically control data collection have shown improved performance in non-disabled populations; however validation of these approaches in a target BCI user population has not occurred. Increasing BCI communication rates with dynamic stopping towards more practical use: an ALS study.
