"We study the relationship between electroencephalographic EEG coherence and accuracy in operating a brain-computer interface BCI. In our case the BCI is controlled through motor imagery. Hence a number of volunteers were trained using different training paradigms: classical visual feedback auditory stimulation and functional electrical stimulation FES. After each training session the volunteers accuracy in operating the BCI was assessed and the event-related coherence ErCoh was calculated for all possible combinations of pairs of EEG sensors. After at least four training sessions we searched for significant differences in accuracy and ErCoh using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and multiple comparison tests. Our results show that there exists a high correlation between an increase in ErCoh and performance improvement and this effect is mainly localized in the centrofrontal and centroparietal brain regions for the case of our motor imagery task. This result has a direct implication with the development of new techniques to evaluate BCI performance and the process of selecting a feedback modality that better enhances the volunteers capacity to operate a BCI system."
