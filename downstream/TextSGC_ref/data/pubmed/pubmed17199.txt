"Virtual surface characteristics of tactile displays are investigated to characterize the feeling of human touch for a haptic interface application. In order to represent the tactile feeling a prototype tactile display incorporating Magneto-Rheological MR fluid has been developed. Tactile display devices simulate the fingers skin to feel the sensations of contact such as compliance friction and topography of the surface. Thus the tactile display can provide information on the surface of an organic tissue to the surgeon in virtual reality. In order to investigate the compliance feeling of a human fingers touch normal force responses of a tactile display under various magnetic fields have been assessed. Also shearing friction force responses of the tactile display are investigated to simulate the action of finger dragging on the surface. Moreover different matrix arrays of magnetic poles are applied to form the virtual surface topography. From the results different tactile feelings are observed according to the applied magnetic field strength as well as the arrays of magnetic poles combinations. This research presents a smart tactile display technology for virtual surfaces." Virtual surface characteristics of a tactile display using magneto-rheological fluids.
