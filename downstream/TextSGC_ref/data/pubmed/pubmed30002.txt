Patients undergoing chemotherapy radiotherapy and immunotherapy experience neurotoxic changes in the central and peripheral nervous system. These neurotoxic changes adversely affect functioning in the sensory motor and cognitive domains. Thereby considerably affecting autonomic activities like gait and posture. Recent evidence from a range of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested the beneficial influence of music-based external auditory stimulations i.e. rhythmic auditory cueing and real-time auditory feedback sonification on gait and postural stability in population groups will balance disorders. This perspective explores the conjunct implications of auditory stimulations during cancer treatment to simultaneously reduce gait and posture related deficits. Underlying neurophysiological mechanisms by which auditory stimulations might influence motor performance have been discussed. Prompt recognition of this sensorimotor training strategy in future studies can have a widespread impact on patient care in all areas of oncology.
