Posterior lumbar interbody fusion PLIF is an established surgical procedure for spine stabilization after the removal of an intervertebral disc. Researches have shown that inserting a single oblique cage has a similar immediate effect to coupled cages and it has been proposed that single-cage PLIF is a useful alternative to traditional two-cage PLIF. However it is not clear whether placing one or two cages represents the best choice for long-term fusion. The aim of this study is to examine how cage placement affects bone remodeling after PLIF surgery and how this consequently impacts the long-term fusion process. Long-term effects of placing one or two cages in instrumented posterior lumbar interbody fusion.
