Deep learning has been actively investigated for various applications such as image classification computer vision and regression tasks and it has shown state-of-the-art performance. In diffuse optical tomography DOT the accurate estimation of the bulk optical properties of a medium is paramount because it directly affects the overall image quality. In this work we exploit deep learning to propose a novel to the best of our knowledge convolutional neural network CNN-based approach to estimate the bulk optical properties of a highly scattering medium such as biological tissue in DOT. We validated the proposed method by using experimental as well as simulated data. For performance assessment we compared the results of the proposed method with those of existing approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-based approach for bulk optical property estimation outperforms existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy with lower computation time.
