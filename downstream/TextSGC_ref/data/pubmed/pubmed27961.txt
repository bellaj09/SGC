A first step in designing a robust and optimal model-based predictive controller MPC for brain-computer interface BCI applications is presented in this article. An MPC has the potential to achieve improved BCI performance compared to the performance achieved by current ad hoc nonmodel-based filter applications. The parameters in designing the controller were extracted as model-based features from motor imagery task-related human scalp electroencephalography. Although the parameters can be generated from any model-linear or non-linear we here adopted a simple autoregressive model that has well-established applications in BCI task discriminations. It was shown that the parameters generated for the controller design can as well be used for motor imagery task discriminations with performance with 8-23% task discrimination errors comparable to the discrimination performance of the commonly used features such as frequency specific band powers and the AR model parameters directly used. An optimal MPC has significant implications for high performance BCI applications. Toward a model-based predictive controller design in brain-computer interfaces.
