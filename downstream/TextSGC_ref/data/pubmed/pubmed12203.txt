The retina is growingly recognized as a window into cerebrovascular and systemic vascular conditions. The utility of noninvasive retinal vessel biomarkers in cerebrovascular risk assessment has expanded due to advances in retinal imaging techniques and machine learning-based digital analysis. The purpose of this review is to underscore the latest evidence linking retinal vascular abnormalities with stroke and vascular-related cognitive disorders; to highlight modern developments in retinal vascular imaging modalities and software-based vasculopathy quantification. Retinal vessel changes in cerebrovascular disease.
