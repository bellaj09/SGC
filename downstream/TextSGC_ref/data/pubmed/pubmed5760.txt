Face perception is critical for normal social functioning and is mediated by a network of regions in the ventral visual stream. In this review we describe recent neuroimaging findings regarding the macro- and microscopic anatomical features of the ventral face network the characteristics of white matter connections and basic computations performed by population receptive fields within face-selective regions composing this network. We emphasize the importance of the neural tissue properties and white matter connections of each region as these anatomical properties may be tightly linked to the functional characteristics of the ventral face network. We end by considering how empirical investigations of the neural architecture of the face network may inform the development of computational models and shed light on how computations in the face network enable efficient face perception.
