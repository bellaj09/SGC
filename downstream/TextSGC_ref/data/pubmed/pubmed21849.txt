Cycling has been used in the rehabilitation of individuals with both chronic and post-surgical conditions. Among the challenges with implementing bicycling for rehabilitation is the recruitment of both extremities in particular when one is weaker or less coordinated. Feedback embedded in virtual reality VR augmented cycling may serve to address the requirement for efficacious cycling; specifically recruitment of both extremities and exercising at a high intensity. Modular mechatronic system for stationary bicycles interfaced with virtual environment for rehabilitation.
