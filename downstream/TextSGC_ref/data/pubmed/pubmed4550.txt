An estimated 70-90% of children with autism spectrum disorder ASD have sensory symptoms which may present as hyper- or hyporesponsivity in one or more sensory modalities. These sensitivities correlate with social symptoms activity and social interaction levels. Interestingly sensory symptoms appear to be most prevalent in late childhood suggesting a developmental component. Although the neural basis of sensory sensitivities remains unclear atypical functional connectivity of sensory brain regions has been suggested as a potential mechanism. Tactile sensitivities are among the most predictive of social functioning yet no studies to our knowledge have examined somatosensory functional connectivity in children and adolescents with ASD when symptoms are typically most prominent. In this study we used human data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE-I to assess functional connectivity differences of somatosensory regions during resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in youth aged 8-15 years. After head motion exclusion our sample included 67 participants with ASD and 121 typically developing controls. We additionally examined associations between functional connectivity and age as well as ASD symptom severity. Together these seed-based analyses showed limited differences in functional connectivity between groups either to hypothesized target regions or in terms of global connectivity. Our findings suggest that hyper- or hyposomatosensory functional connectivity at rest is not a population-level feature in ASD. However this does not preclude increased variability of somatosensory networks across the ASD population. Furthermore as sensory sensitivities were not specifically assessed in this sample future studies may be better able to identify patterns of functional connectivity reflecting individual differences in sensory symptoms.
