Understanding the genetic background of complex diseases and disorders plays an essential role in the promising precision medicine. The evaluation of candidate genes however requires time-consuming and expensive experiments given a large number of possibilities. Thus computational methods have seen increasing applications in predicting gene-disease associations. We proposed a bioinformatics framework Prioritization of Autism-genes using Network-based Deep-learning Approach PANDA. Our approach aims to identify autism-genes across the human genome based on patterns of gene-gene interactions and topological similarity of genes in the interaction network. PANDA trains a graph deep learning classifier using the input of the human molecular interaction network and predicts and ranks the probability of autism association of every node gene in the network. PANDA was able to achieve a high classification accuracy of 89% outperforming three other commonly used machine learning algorithms. Moreover the gene prioritization ranking list produced by PANDA was evaluated and validated using an independent large-scale exome-sequencing study. The top 10% of PANDA-ranked genes were found significantly enriched for autism association. PANDA: Prioritization of autism-genes using network-based deep-learning approach.
