"The use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is supported by numerous outcome studies. Similar research for children is lagging behind. The outcome studies on the use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in children currently address only specific phobias and all of the available trials are reviewed in this article. Despite the limited number of studies results are very encouraging for the treatment of school and spider phobias. A study with adolescents suggests that at least for social anxiety exposure stimuli would be more effective if they were developed specifically for younger populations. Virtual reality may not increase childrens motivation towards therapy unless their fearful apprehension is addressed before initiating the treatment." Could virtual reality be effective in treating children with phobias?
