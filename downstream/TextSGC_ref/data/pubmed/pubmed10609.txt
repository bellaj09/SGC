We aimed to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system CAD for predicting colorectal polyp histology using deep-learning technology and to validate its performance. Near-focus narrow-band imaging NBI pictures of colorectal polyps were retrieved from the database of our institution. Of these 12480 image patches of 624 polyps were used as a training set to develop the CAD. The CAD performance was validated with two test datasets of 545 polyps. Polyps were classified into three histological groups: serrated polyp SP benign adenoma BA/mucosal or superficial submucosal cancer MSMC and deep submucosal cancer DSMC. The overall kappa value measuring the agreement between the true polyp histology and the expected histology by the CAD was 0.614-0.642 which was higher than that of trainees n\u2009=\u20096 endoscopists with experience of 100 NBI colonoscopies in <6 months; 0.368-0.401 and almost comparable with that of the experts n\u2009=\u20093 endoscopists with experience of 2500 NBI colonoscopies in 5 years 0.649-0.735. The areas under the receiver operating curves for CAD were 0.93-0.95 0.86-0.89 and 0.89-0.91 for SP BA/MSMC and DSMC respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the CAD was 81.3-82.4% which was significantly higher than that of the trainees 63.8-71.8% P\u2009<\u20090.01 and comparable with that of experts 82.4-87.3%. The kappa value and diagnostic accuracies of the trainees improved with CAD assistance: that is the kappa value increased from 0.368 to 0.655 and the overall diagnostic accuracy increased from 63.8-71.8% to 82.7-84.2%. CAD using a deep-learning model can accurately assess polyp histology and may facilitate the diagnosis of colorectal polyps by endoscopists.
