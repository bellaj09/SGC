The combination of brain-computer interfaces BCIs with robot-assisted physical therapy constitutes a promising approach to neurorehabilitation of patients with severe hemiparetic syndromes caused by cerebrovascular brain damage e.g. stroke and other neurological conditions. In such a scenario a key aspect is how to reestablish the disrupted sensorimotor feedback loop. However to date it is an open question how artificially closing the sensorimotor feedback loop influences the decoding performance of a BCI. In this paper we answer this issue by studying six healthy subjects and two stroke patients. We present empirical evidence that haptic feedback provided by a seven degrees of freedom robotic arm facilitates online decoding of arm movement intention. The results support the feasibility of future rehabilitative treatments based on the combination of robot-assisted physical therapy with BCIs. Closing the sensorimotor loop: haptic feedback facilitates decoding of motor imagery.
