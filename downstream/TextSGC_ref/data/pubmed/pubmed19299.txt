Several lines of evidence suggest hippocampal dysfunction in major depression but the prevalence and nature of specific dysfunctions during the long-term course of major depression is yet to be assessed. A 3D virtual environment navigation task and measurements of hippocampal volume were assessed in remitted former inpatients with moderate to severe depression after an 8 year follow-up period to evaluate whether functional and structural differences existed in the hippocampus beyond depression.
