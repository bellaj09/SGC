Thermal cameras are popular in detection for their precision in surveillance in the dark and for privacy preservation. In the era of data driven problem solving approaches manually finding and annotating a large amount of data is inefficient in terms of cost and effort. With the introduction of transfer learning rather than having large datasets a dataset covering all characteristics and aspects of the target place is more important. In this work we studied a large thermal dataset recorded for 20 weeks and identified nine phenomena in it. Moreover we investigated the impact of each phenomenon for model adaptation in transfer learning. Each phenomenon was investigated separately and in combination. the performance was analyzed by computing the F1 score precision recall true negative rate and false negative rate. Furthermore to underline our investigation the trained model with our dataset was further tested on publicly available datasets and encouraging results were obtained. Finally our dataset was also made publicly available. The Effect of a Diverse Dataset for Transfer Learning in Thermal Person Detection.
