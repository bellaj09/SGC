For radiofrequency ablation RFA of liver tumors evaluation of vascular architecture post-RFA necrosis prediction and the choice of a suitable needle placement strategy using conventional radiological techniques remain difficult. In an attempt to enhance the safety of RFA a 3D simulator treatment planning and training tool that simulates the insertion of the needle the necrosis of the treated area and proposes an optimal needle placement has been developed. The 3D scenes are automatically reconstructed from enhanced spiral CT scans. The simulator takes into account the cooling effect of local vessels greater than 3 mm in diameter making necrosis shapes more realistic. Optimal needle positioning can be automatically generated by the software to produce complete destruction of the tumor with maximum respect of the healthy liver and of all major structures to avoid. We also studied how the use of virtual reality and haptic devices are valuable to make simulation and training realistic and effective.
