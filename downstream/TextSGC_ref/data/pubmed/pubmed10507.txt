In this white paper experts from the Digital Pathology Association DPA define terminology and concepts in the emerging field of computational pathology with a focus on its application to histology images analyzed together with their associated patient data to extract information. This review offers a historical perspective and describes the potential clinical benefits from research and applications in this field as well as significant obstacles to adoption. Best practices for implementing computational pathology workflows are presented. These include infrastructure considerations acquisition of training data quality assessments as well as regulatory ethical and cyber-security concerns. Recommendations are provided for regulators vendors and computational pathology practitioners in order to facilitate progress in the field.  2019 The Authors.
