One way to identify genes possibly associated with ageing is to build a classification model from the machine learning field capable of classifying genes as associated with multiple age-related diseases. To build this model we use a pre-compiled list of human genes associated with age-related diseases and apply a novel Deep Neural Network DNN method to find associations between gene descriptors e.g. Gene Ontology terms protein-protein interaction data and biological pathway information and age-related diseases. Using deep learning to associate human genes with age-related diseases.
