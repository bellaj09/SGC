"The receptor for advanced glycation end products RAGE has been identified as a therapeutic target in a host of pathological diseases including Alzheimers disease. RAGE is a target with no crystallographic data on inhibitors in complex with RAGE multiple hypothesized binding modes and small amounts of activity data. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of deep-learning DL techniques on small bioactivity datasets and to identify candidate inhibitors of RAGE. We applied transfer learning in the form of a semi-supervised molecular representation in order to address small dataset problems. To validate the candidate inhibitors we examined them using more computationally expensive pharmacophore-modeling and docking techniques. We created a strong classifier of RAGE activity producing 79 candidate inhibitors. These candidates agreed with docking models and were shown to have no significant statistical difference from pharmacophore-based results. The transfer-learning techniques used allow DL to generalize chemical features from small bioactivity datasets to a broader library of compounds with high accuracy. Furthermore the DL model is able to handle multiple binding modes without explicit instructions. Our results demonstrate the potential of a broad family of DL techniques on bioactivity predictions."
