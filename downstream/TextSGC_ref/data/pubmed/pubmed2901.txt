There is ample evidence of atypical functional connectivity FC in autism spectrum disorders ASDs. However transient relationships between neural networks cannot be captured by conventional static FC analyses. Dynamic FC dFC approaches have been used to identify repeating transient connectivity patterns "states" revealing spatiotemporal network properties not observable in static FC. Recent studies have found atypical dFC in ASDs but questions remain about the nature of group differences in transient connectivity and the degree to which states persist or change over time. This study aimed to: a describe and relate static and dynamic FC in typical development and ASDs b describe group differences in transient states and compare them with static FC patterns and c examine temporal stability and flexibility between identified states. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data were collected from 62 ASD and 57 typically developing TD children and adolescents. Whole-brain data-driven regions of interest were derived from group independent component analysis. Sliding window analysis and k-means clustering were used to explore dFC and identify transient states. Across all regions static overconnnectivity and increased variability over time in ASDs predominated. Furthermore significant patterns of group differences emerged in two transient states that were not observed in the static FC matrix with group differences in one state primarily involving sensory and motor networks and in the other involving higher-order cognition networks. Default mode network segregation was significantly reduced in ASDs in both states. Results highlight that dynamic approaches may reveal more nuanced transient patterns of atypical FC in ASDs.
