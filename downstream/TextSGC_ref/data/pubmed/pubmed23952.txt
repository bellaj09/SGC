"Virtual reality VR has the potential to offer experiences which are engaging and rewarding. In VR the focus is shifted from the persons efforts in producing a movement or completing a task to that of interaction with the virtual environment. We have found that participants place value and meaning on and enjoy the activities programmed. Virtual reality interventions have been shown to improve cognitive function and concentration through an individuals interaction with a pleasant activity. Importantly the enjoyment experienced while working with VR may increase the level of participation. In addition to generating realistic situations for testing intervention and collection of data the provision of immediate and positive feedback through VR has been shown to increase self esteem and empowerment. We will report outcomes from several intervention and feasibility trials using a flat screen virtual reality system with survivors of traumatic brain injury community living older adults and children with spastic cerebral palsy. Gross motor movements were elicited through various game-like VR applications without the need for head-mounted displays or other peripherals. The impact of VR exercise participation ranged from improvements in clinical measures of functional balance and mobility time on task as well as participant and care provider perceptions of enjoyment independence and confidence. Although still preliminary our data suggest that simple applications of virtual reality have significant impacts on physical and psychosocial variables. Possibilities for and benefits of home and community-based access to virtual reality based programs will be explored." Outcomes of intervention programs using flatscreen virtual reality.
