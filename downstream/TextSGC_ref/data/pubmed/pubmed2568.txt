There is minimal information on COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals. We have studied 10 patients treated at 12 adult care hospitals. Ten kidney transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and 9 were admitted. The median age was 57 IQR 47-67 60% were male 40% Caucasian and 30% Black/African American. Median time from transplant to COVID-19 testing was 2822 days IQR 1272-4592. The most common symptom was fever followed by cough myalgia chills and fatigue. The most common CXR and CT abnormality was multifocal patchy opacities. 3 patients had no abnormal findings. Leukopenia was seen in 20% of patients and allograft function was stable in 50% of patients. 9 patients were on tacrolimus and a mycophenolic antimetabolite and 70% were on prednisone. Hospitalized patients had their antimetabolite agent stopped. All hospitalized patients received hydroxychloroquine HCQ and azithromycin. 3 patients died 30% five 50% developed acute kidney injury. Kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be monitored closely in the setting of lowered immunosuppression. Most individuals required hospitalization and presenting symptoms were similar to those of non-transplant individuals. COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients.
