"Human locomotion is a complex process that requires the integration of central and peripheral nervous signalling. Understanding the brains involvement in locomotion is challenging and is traditionally investigated during locomotor imagination or observation. However stationary imaging methods lack the ability to infer information about the peripheral and central signalling during actual task execution. In this report we present a dataset containing simultaneously recorded electroencephalography EEG lower-limb electromyography EMG and full body motion capture recorded from ten able-bodied individuals. The subjects completed an average of twenty trials on an experimental gait course containing level-ground ramps and stairs. We recorded 60-channel EEG from the scalp and 4-channel EOG from the face and temples. Surface EMG was recorded from six muscle sites bilaterally on the thigh and shank. The motion capture system consisted of seventeen wireless IMUs allowing for unconstrained ambulation in the experimental space. In this report we present the rationale for collecting these data a detailed explanation of the experimental setup and a brief validation of the data quality."
