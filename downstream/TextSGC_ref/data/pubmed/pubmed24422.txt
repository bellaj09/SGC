Walking is an innate human behavior that propels the body forward. Recent studies have investigated the creation of a walking sensation wherein the body neither moves nor is forced to move. However it is unclear which whole-body motions effectively induce the sensation of walking. Here we show that passive whole-body motions such as heave and/or yaw motions produced by a motorized chair induced a sensation of walking for seated participants in virtual environments as if the participant were walking while viewing a virtual reality scene through a head-mounted display. Our findings suggest that the passive whole-body motions in the gravitational axis-and to a lesser extent in the yaw axis-provide a clear perception of pseudo-walking but only with limited motion amplitudes namely one-fourth or less than those of actual walking. In addition we found a negative correlation between the scores of walking sensation and motion sickness.
