Heart rate variability is a physiological measure associated with autonomic nervous system activity. This study hypothesized that lower pre-deployment HRV would be associated with higher post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD symptoms. Three-hundred-forty-three Army National Guard soldiers enrolled in the Warriors Achieving Resilience WAR study were analyzed. The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity using the PTSD Checklist - Military version PCL measured at baseline 3- and 12-month post-deployment. Heart rate variability predictor variables included: high frequency power HF and standard deviation of the normal cardiac inter-beat interval SDNN. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that the pre-deployment PCL*lnHF interaction term was significant p<0.0001. Pre-deployment SDNN was not a significant predictor of post-deployment PCL. Covariates included age pre-deployment PCL race/ethnicity marital status tobacco use childhood abuse pre-deployment traumatic brain injury and previous combat zone deployment. Pre-deployment heart rate variability predicts post-deployment PTSD symptoms in the context of higher pre-deployment PCL scores. Heart rate variability: Pre-deployment predictor of post-deployment PTSD symptoms.
