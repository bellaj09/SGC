Connectivity modeling in functional neuroimaging has become widely used method of analysis for understanding functional architecture. One method for deriving directed connectivity models is Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation GIMME; Gates and Molenaar 2012. GIMME looks for commonalities across the sample to detect signal from noise and arrive at edges that exist across the majority in the group "group-level edges" and individual-level edges. In this way GIMME obtains generalizable results via the group-level edges while also allowing for between subject heterogeneity in connectivity moving the field closer to obtaining reliable personalized connectivity maps. In this article we present a novel extension of GIMME confirmatory subgrouping GIMME which estimates subgroup-level edges for a priori known groups e.g. typically developing controls vs. clinical group. Detecting edges that consistently exist for individuals within predefined subgroups aids in interpretation of the heterogeneity in connectivity maps and allows for subgroup-specific inferences. We describe this algorithm as well as several methods to examine the results. We present an empirical example that finds similarities and differences in resting state functional connectivity among four groups of children: typically developing controls TDC children with autism spectrum disorder ASD children with Inattentive ADHD-I and Combined ADHD-C Type ADHD. Findings from this study suggest common involvement of the left Broca\s area in all the clinical groups as well as several unique patterns of functional connectivity specific to a given disorder. Overall the current approach and proof of principle findings highlight a novel and reliable tool for capturing heterogeneity in complex mental health disorders.
