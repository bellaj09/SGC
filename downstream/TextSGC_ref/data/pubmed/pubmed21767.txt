Among the various EU research projects concerning the medical application of virtual reality the project Ist-1999-12175 called IERAPSI Integrated Environment for the Rehearsal and Planning of Surgical Interventions specifically addressed the creation of a virtual and interactive surgical field for the temporal bone using three-dimensional images derived from CT data. We report on the experience obtained in the IERAPSI project in simulating a canal wall-up mastoidectomy. A surgeon with extensive experience in surgery of the petrous bone performed the mastoidectomy. The operative field included the mastoid with its substantial differences in density between the cortex and the pneumatized bone together with soft tissue structures both on the border and inside the bone. The simulation is better in the first part of the operation than in the second part suffering from a lack of haptic feedback from soft tissue and the surgical tool in deeper contexts and under-representation of the variability inherent in pneumatized bone. This said the excellent representation of dust production and removal 3D simulation through color and very good visual and haptic feedback in the early stage of the procedure are impressive. IERAPSI represents a potential surgical planning theater for the training of students and young surgeons but is also expected to aid expert surgeons in the preoperative planning of difficult cases.
