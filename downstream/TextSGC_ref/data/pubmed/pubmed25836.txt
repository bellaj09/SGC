The age-honored practice of plowing through the Index Medicus in a good medical library to meander through citations for treasured finds is an anachronism. Today clinicians have the astonishing capacity to bring to bear existing knowledge almost effortlessly. Virtual scholarship makes available up-to-date medical citations and their abstracts. There can be access around the clock on any topic in the office at the bedside or from home. Computerized searches of the medical literature promote directed continuing education and may enhance clinical care of patients. Accessing the scientific literature. The reality of virtual scholarship.
