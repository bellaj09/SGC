We present the SurfacE Electromyographic with hanD kinematicS SEEDS database. It contains electromyographic EMG signals and hand kinematics recorded from the forearm muscles of 25 non-disabled subjects while performing 13 different movements at normal and slow-paced speeds. EMG signals were recorded with a high-density 126-channel array centered on the extrinsic flexors of the fingers and 8 further electrodes placed on the extrinsic extensor muscles. A data-glove was used to record 18 angles from the joints of the wrist and fingers. The correct synchronisation of the data-glove and the EMG was ascertained and the resulting data were further validated by implementing a simple classification of the movements. These data can be used to test experimental hypotheses regarding EMG and hand kinematics. Our database allows for the extraction of the neural drive as well as performing electrode selection from the high-density EMG signals. Moreover the hand kinematic signals allow the development of proportional methods of control of the hand in addition to the more traditional movement classification approaches. SEEDS simultaneous recordings of high-density EMG and finger joint angles during multiple hand movements.
