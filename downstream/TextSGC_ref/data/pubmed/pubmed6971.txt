Periods of euthymia in bipolar disorder BD serve as a valuable time to study trait-based pathophysiology. The use of resting state functional connectivity Rs-FC can aid in the understanding of BD pathophysiology free of task or mood state biases. The present study investigated two unexplored areas of Rs-FC research in bipolar remission: i Rs-FC in women controlling for the potential influence of premenstrual symptoms and ii the use of both independent component analysis ICA and seed-based analysis SBA to investigate Rs-FC. Resting state functional connectivity in women with bipolar disorder during clinical remission.
