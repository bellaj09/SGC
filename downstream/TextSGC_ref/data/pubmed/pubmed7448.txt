Recognizing the widespread existence of intrinsically disordered regions in proteins spurred the development of computational techniques for their detection. All existing techniques can be classified into methods relying on single-sequence information and those relying on evolutionary sequence profiles generated from multiple-sequence alignments. The methods based on sequence profiles are in general more accurate because the presence or absence of conserved amino acid residues in a protein sequence provides important information on the structural and functional roles of the residues. However the wide applicability of profile-based techniques is limited by time-consuming calculation of sequence profiles. Here we demonstrate that the performance gap between profile-based techniques and single-sequence methods can be reduced by using an ensemble of deep recurrent and convolutional neural networks that allow whole-sequence learning. In particular the single-sequence method called SPOT-Disorder-Single is more accurate than SPOT-Disorder a profile-based method for proteins with few homologous sequences and comparable for proteins in predicting long-disordered regions. The method performance is robust across four independent test sets with different amounts of short- and long-disordered regions. SPOT-Disorder-Single is available as a Web server and as a standalone program at http://sparks-lab.org/jack/server/SPOT-Disorder-Single .
