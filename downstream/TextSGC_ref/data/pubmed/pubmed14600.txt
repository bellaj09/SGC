In this paper the uncertain direct of the hysteretic system component will be considered. Besides the effect of stochastic disturbance inevitably exists in many practical systems which would cause the instability. Simultaneously it is significant to guarantee the perfect error tracking performance for the uncertain nonlinear hysteresis systems when operation suffers the failure. To ensure the maintaining acceptable system performance in reality the new properties of the Nussbaum function are proposed and an auxiliary virtual controller is designed through the neural network NN universal approximator. Furthermore it is challenged to save the system-limited transmutation resource for nonlinear systems especially for stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown hysteresis input and actuator failures. The coupling effect of the system communication resource constrains has to arise the issue of the mutual coupling function which makes that the tracking control design is more complicated. Using the proposed event-triggered controller and back-stepping technology a new optimization algorithm is proposed to ensure that the states of the closed-loop system and the tracking error remain bounded in probability. Finally to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive NN control method with the event-triggered strategy some numerical examples are provided.
