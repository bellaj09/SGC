"Electrocorticogram ECoG-based brain-computer interfaces BCIs are a promising platform for the restoration of motor and sensory functions to those with neurological deficits. Such bi-directional BCI operation necessitates simultaneous ECoG recording and stimulation which is challenging given the presence of strong stimulation artifacts. This problem is exacerbated if the BCIs analog front-end operates in an ultra-low power regime which is a basic requirement for fully implantable medical devices. In this study we developed a novel method for the suppression of stimulation artifacts before they reach the analog front-end." Optimal artifact suppression in simultaneous electrocorticography stimulation and recording for bi-directional brain-computer interface applications.
