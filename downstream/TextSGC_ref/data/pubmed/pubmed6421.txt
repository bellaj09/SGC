Our study aimed to clarify the neuroimaging correlates of suicide attempt by comparing differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI among depressed suicide attempters depressed patients without suicide attempt history and healthy controls through comprehensive and novel fMRI analyses and methods in the same study population. The association between depression severity and aspects of the brain imaging was also discussed. Our study recruited 109 participants who were assigned to three groups: 33 depressed patients with suicide attempt SA 32 depressed patients without suicide attempt NS and 44 healthy controls HC. All participants were scanned using a 3 T MRI imaging system to obtain resting-state functional images. In seed-based correlation analysis we found altered functional connectivity in some brain regions of the SA compared with the NS or HC especially in the hippocampus and thalamus. In the voxel-based analysis our results showed differential activation and regional homogeneity of the temporal lobe and several brain regions in the SA compared with the NS and HC. We also found that some brain areas correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAM-D anxiety and depression scores especially in the frontal and temporal lobes. Graph theoretical analysis GTA and network-based statistical NBS analyses revealed different topological organization as well as slightly better global integration and worse local segregation of the brain network i.e. more like a random network in depressed participants compared with healthy participants. We concluded that the brain function of major depressive disorders with and without suicide attempts changed compared with healthy participants.
