"Neurostimulation remarkably alleviates the symptoms in a variety of brain disorders by modulating the brain-wide network. However how brain-wide effects on the direct and indirect pathways evoked by focal neurostimulation elicit therapeutic effects in an individual patient is unknown. Understanding this remains crucial for advancing neural circuit-based guidance to optimize candidate patient screening pre-surgical target selection and post-surgical parameter tuning. To address this issue we propose a functional brain connectome-based modeling approach that simulates the spreading effects of stimulating different brain regions and quantifies the rectification of abnormal network topology in silico. We validated these analyses by pinpointing nuclei in the basal ganglia circuits as top-ranked targets for 43 local patients with Parkinsons disease and 90 patients from a public database. Individual connectome-based analysis demonstrated that the globus pallidus was the best choice for 21.1% and the subthalamic nucleus for 19.5% of patients. Down-regulation of functional connectivity up to 12% at these prioritized targets optimally maximized the therapeutic effects. Notably the priority rank of the subthalamic nucleus significantly correlated with motor symptom severity Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale III in the local cohort. These findings underscore the potential of neural network modeling for advancing personalized brain stimulation therapy and warrant future experimental investigation to validate its clinical utility."
