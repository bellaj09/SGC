Brain-computer interfaces build a communication pathway from the human brain to a computer. Motor imagery-based electroencephalogram EEG classification is a widely applied paradigm in brain-computer interfaces. The common spatial pattern based on the event-related desynchronization ERD/event-related synchronization ERS phenomenon is one of the most popular algorithms for motor imagery-based EEG classification. Moreover the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature based on the event-related potential phenomenon has been demonstrated to provide complementary information to ERD/ERS-based features. In this paper aiming to improve the performance of motor imagery-based EEG classification in a few-channel situation an ensemble support vector learning ESVL-based approach is proposed to combine the advantages of the ERD/ERS-based features and the event-related potential-based features in motor imagery-based EEG classification. Motor imagery EEG classification based on ensemble support vector learning.
