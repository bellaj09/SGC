Implantable microsystems that collect and transmit neural data are becoming very useful entities in the field of neuroscience. Limited by high data rates on-chip compression is often required to transmit the recorded data without causing power dissipation at levels that would damage sensitive brain tissue. This paper presents a data compression system designed for brain-computer interfaces BCIs based on undercomplete autoencoders. To the best of our knowledge the proposed system is the first to achieve an average spike reconstruction quality of 14-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio SNDR at a 32 compression ratio CR 18-dB SNDR at a 16 CR 22-dB SNDR at an 8 CR and 35-dB SNDR at a 4 CR of neural spikes. The spike detection and autoencoder-based compression modules are designed and implemented in a standard 45-nm CMOS process. The post-synthesis simulation results report that the compression module consumes between 1.4 and 222.5 Formula: see text of power per channel and takes between 0.018 and 0.082mm2 of silicon area depending on the desired CR and number of channels.
