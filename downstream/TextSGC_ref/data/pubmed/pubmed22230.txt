To resolve the contradiction between large field of view and high resolution in immersive virtual reality VR head-mounted displays HMDs an HMD monocular optical system with a large field of view and high resolution was designed. The system was fabricated by adopting aspheric technology with CNC grinding and a high-resolution LCD as the image source. With this monocular optical system an HMD binocular optical system with a wide-range continuously adjustable interpupillary distance was achieved in the form of partially overlapping fields of view FOV combined with a screw adjustment mechanism. A fast image processor-centered LCD driver circuit and an image preprocessing system were also built to address binocular vision inconsistency in the partially overlapping FOV binocular optical system. The distortions of the HMD optical system with a large field of view were measured. Meanwhile the optical distortions in the display and the trapezoidal distortions introduced during image processing were corrected by a calibration model for reverse rotations and translations. A high-performance not-fully-transparent VR HMD device with high resolution 19201080 and large FOV 141.6H73.08V was developed. The full field-of-view average value of angular resolution is 18.6\u2009\u2009pixels/degree. With the device high-quality VR simulations can be completed under various scenarios and the device can be utilized for simulated trainings in aeronautics astronautics and other fields with corresponding platforms. The developed device has positive practical significance. Development of an immersive virtual reality head-mounted display with high performance.
