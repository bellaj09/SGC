Computed tomography CT is a popular medical imaging modality and enjoys wide clinical applications. At the same time the x-ray radiation dose associated with CT scannings raises a public concern due to its potential risks to the patients. Over the past years major efforts have been dedicated to the development of Low-Dose CT LDCT methods. However the radiation dose reduction compromises the signal-to-noise ratio SNR leading to strong noise and artifacts that downgrade CT image quality. In this paper we propose a novel 3D noise reduction method called Structurally-sensitive Multi-scale Generative Adversarial Net SMGAN to improve the LDCT image quality. Specifically we incorporate three-dimensional 3D volumetric information to improve the image quality. Also different loss functions for training denoising models are investigated. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively preserve structural and textural information in reference to normal-dose CT NDCT images and significantly suppress noise and artifacts. Qualitative visual assessments by three experienced radiologists demonstrate that the proposed method retrieves more information and outperforms competing methods.
