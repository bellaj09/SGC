Virtual reality VR offers unprecedented opportunity as a scientific tool to study visuomotor interactions training and rehabilitation applications. However it remains unclear if haptic-free hand-object interactions in a virtual environment VE may differ from those performed in the physical environment PE. We therefore sought to establish if the coordination structure between the transport and grasp components remain similar whether a reach-to-grasp movement is performed in PE and VE. Coordination of reach-to-grasp in physical and haptic-free virtual environments.
