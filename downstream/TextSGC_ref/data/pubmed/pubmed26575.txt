To solve the eye fatigue problem on using the well known steady state visual evoked potential SSVEP-based brain-computer interface BCI system the steady state auditory evoked potential SSAEP becomes one of the promising BCI modalities. However SSAEP-based BCI system still suffers from the low accuracy. To increase the accuracy in this paper we propose the new training method to enhance the SSAEP training session. The training process is enhanced by making the users control their attention levels simultaneously with the detected auditory stimulus frequency. Furthermore with the proposed training method we also propose the corresponding single-frequency/multi-commands BCI paradigm. With the proposed paradigm four commands can be detected by using only one auditory stimulus frequency. The proposed training system yields approximately 81% accuracy compared with 66% of the session without performing the proposed training. On the enhancement of training session performance via attention for single-frequency/multi-commands based steady state auditory evoked potential BCI.
