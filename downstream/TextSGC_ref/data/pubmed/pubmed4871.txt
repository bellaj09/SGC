"Functional neuroimaging has great potential to inform clinical decisions whether by identifying neural biomarkers of illness progression and severity predicting therapeutic response or selecting suitable patients for surgical interventions. Yet a persisting barrier to functional neuroimagings clinical translation is our incomplete understanding of how normative variance in cognition personality and behavior shape the brains structural and functional organization. We propose that modeling individual differences in these brain-behavior relationships is crucial for improving the accuracy of neuroimaging biomarkers for neurologic and psychiatric disorders." Task-dependent recruitment of intrinsic brain networks reflects normative variance in cognition.
