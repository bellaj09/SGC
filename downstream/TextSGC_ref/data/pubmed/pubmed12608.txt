"Current sleep medicine relies on the supervised analysis of polysomnographic measurements comprising amongst others electroencephalogram EEG electromyogram EMG and electrooculogram EOG signals. Convolutional neural networks CNN provide an interesting framework to automated classification of sleep based on these raw waveforms. In this study we compare existing CNN approaches to four databases of pathological and physiological subjects. The best performing model resulted in Cohens Kappa of $\\kappa = 0 .75$ on healthy subjects and $\\kappa = 0 .64$ on patients suffering from a variety of sleep disorders. Further we show the advantages of additional sensor data i.e. EOG and EMG. Deep learning approaches require a lot of data which is scarce for less prevalent diseases. For this we propose a transfer learning procedure by pretraining a model on large public data and fine-tune this on each subject from a smaller dataset. This procedure is demonstrated using a private REM Behaviour Disorder database improving sleep classification by 24.4%."
