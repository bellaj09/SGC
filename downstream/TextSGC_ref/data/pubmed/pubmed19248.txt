Due to recent advances in virtual reality VR technology the development of immersive VR applications that track body motions and visualize a full-body avatar is attracting increasing research interest. This paper reviews related research to gather and to critically analyze recent improvements regarding the potential of full-body motion reconstruction in VR applications. We conducted a systematic literature search matching VR and full-body tracking related keywords on IEEE Xplore PubMed ACM and Scopus. Fifty-three publications were included and assigned in three groups: studies using markerless and marker-based motion tracking systems as well as systems using inertial measurement units. All analyzed research publications track the motions of the user wearing a head-mounted display and visualize a full-body avatar. The analysis confirmed that a full-body avatar can enhance the sense of embodiment and can improve the immersion within the VR. The results indicated that the Kinect device is still the most frequently used sensor 27 out of 53. Furthermore there is a trend to track the movements of multiple users simultaneously. Many studies that enable multiplayer mode in VR use marker-based systems 7 out of 17 because they are much more robust and can accurately track full-body movements of multiple users in real-time.
