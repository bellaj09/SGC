Advances in neurotechnology are expected to provide access to thousands of neural channel recordings including neuronal spiking multiunit activity and local field potentials. In addition recent studies have shown that deep learning in particular recurrent neural networks RNNs provide promising approaches for decoding of large-scale neural data. These approaches involve computationally intensive algorithms with millions of parameters. In this context an important challenge in the application of neural decoding to next generation brain-computer interfaces for complex human tasks is the development of low-latency real-time implementations. We demonstrate a Field-Programmable Gate Array FPGA implementation of Long Short-Term Memory LSTM RNNs for decoding 10000 channels of neural data on a mobile lowpower embedded system platform called "NeuroCoder". We provide a proof of concept in the context of decoding 20dimensional spectrotemporal representation of spoken words from simulated 10000 neural channels. In this particular case the LSTM model included 4042420 parameters. In addition to providing multiple communication interfaces for the BCI system the NeuroCoder platform can achieve sub-millisecond real-time latencies.
