This study sought to determine general practice GP specialty trainee ST3 knowledge of coaching views on leadership training and reflections on the experience of receiving coaching. All GP ST3s in one UK region completed a questionnaire about coaching and developing leadership abilities. Six received professional coaching sessions followed by a semi-structured interview. Baseline knowledge of coaching was sparse. Trainees felt under-equipped for leadership but were keen to develop themselves. The short intervention appeared to result in a shift in leadership mind-set in four key areas: courage passion impact and vision. A new enthusiasm was apparent as well as a willingness and desire to increase leadership responsibilities. This is the first UK study examining professional executive face-to-face coaching as an educational method for doctors. Coaching helps provide leadership language and identity. It appears to name clients as leaders and challenges imposter phenomenon. Coaching provided bespoke deep experiential learning with transferable benefits not otherwise available in the Specialty Training programme."
