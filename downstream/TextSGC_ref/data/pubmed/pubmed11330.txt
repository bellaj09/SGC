Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its consequences are a growing public health concern requiring cross-sectional imaging for noninvasive diagnosis and quantification of liver fat. Purpose To investigate a deep learning-based automated liver fat quantification tool at nonenhanced CT for establishing the prevalence of steatosis in a large screening cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study a fully automated liver segmentation algorithm was applied to noncontrast abdominal CT examinations from consecutive asymptomatic adults by using three-dimensional convolutional neural networks including a subcohort with follow-up scans. Automated volume-based liver attenuation was analyzed including conversion to CT fat fraction and compared with manual measurement in a large subset of scans. Results A total of 11 669 CT scans in 9552 adults mean age  standard deviation 57.2 years  7.9; 5314 women and 4238 men; median body mass index BMI 27.8 kg/m2 were evaluated including 2117 follow-up scans in 1862 adults mean age 59.2 years; 971 women and 891 men; mean interval 5.5 years. Algorithm failure occurred in seven scans. Mean CT liver attenuation was 55 HU  10 corresponding to CT fat fraction of 6.4% slightly fattier in men than in women 7.4%  6.0 vs 5.8%  5.7%; P < .001. Mean liver Hounsfield unit varied little by age <4 HU difference among all age groups and only weak correlation was seen with BMI r2 = 0.14. By category 47.9% 5584 of 11 669 had negligible or no liver fat CT fat fraction <5% 42.4% 4948 of 11 669 had mild steatosis CT fat fraction of 5%-14% 8.8% 1025 of 11 669 had moderate steatosis CT fat fraction of 14%-28% and 1% 112 of 11 669 had severe steatosis CT fat fraction >28%. Excellent agreement was seen between automated and manual measurements with a mean difference of 2.7 HU median 3 HU and r2 of 0.92. Among the subcohort with longitudinal follow-up mean change was only -3 HU  9 but 43.3% 806 of 1861 of patients changed steatosis category between first and last scans. Conclusion This fully automated CT-based liver fat quantification tool allows for population-based assessment of hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with objective data that match well with manual measurement. The prevalence of at least mild steatosis was greater than 50% in this asymptomatic screening cohort.
