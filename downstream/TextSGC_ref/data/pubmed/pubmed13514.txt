In three experiments learning performance in a 6- or 7-week cognitive-science based computer-study programme was compared to equal time spent self-studying on paper. The first two experiments were conducted with grade 6 and 7 children in a high risk educational setting the third with Columbia University undergraduates. The principles the programme implemented included 1 deep meaningful elaborative multimodal processing 2 transfer-appropriate processing 3 self-generation and multiple testing of responses and 4 spaced practice. The programme was also designed to thwart metacognitive illusions that would otherwise lead to inappropriate study patterns. All three experiments showed a distinct advantage in final test performance for the cognitive-science based programme but this advantage was particularly prominent in the children. A cognitive-science based programme to enhance study efficacy in a high and low risk setting.
