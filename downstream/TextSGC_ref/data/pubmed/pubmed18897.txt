A new image-guided microscope using augmented reality overlays has been developed. Unlike other systems the novelty of our design consists in mounting a precise mini and low-cost tracker directly on the microscope to track the motion of the surgical tools and the patient. Correctly scaled cut-views of the pre-operative computed tomography CT stack can be displayed on the overlay orthogonal to the optical view or even including the direction of a clinical tool. Moreover the system can manage three-dimensional models for tumours or bone structures and allows interaction with them using virtual tools showing trajectories and distances. The mean error of the overlay was 0.7 mm. Clinical accuracy has shown results of 1.1-1.8 mm. Image-guided surgical microscope with mounted minitracker.
