Objective: We evaluated the evidence supporting the use of virtual reality among patients in acute inpatient medical settings. Method: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials conducted that examined virtual reality applications in inpatient medical settings between 2005 and 2015. We used PsycINFO PubMed and Medline databases to identify studies using the keywords virtual reality VR therapy treatment and inpatient.Results: We identified 2024 citations among which 11 met criteria for inclusion. Studies addressed three general areas: pain management eating disorders and cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Studies were small and heterogeneous and utilized different designs and measures. Virtual reality was generally well tolerated by patients and a majority of studies demonstrated clinical efficacy. Studies varied in quality as measured by an evaluation metric developed by Reisch Tyson and Mize average quality score=0.87; range=0.78-0.96. Conclusion: Virtual reality is a promising intervention with several potential applications in the inpatient medical setting. Studies to date demonstrate some efficacy but there is a need for larger well-controlled studies to show clinical and cost-effectiveness.
