Breast cancer grading is important for patient prognosis and the mitosis count is one of the most important indicators for breast cancer grading. Traditional methods use handcraft features and deep learning based methods to detect mitosis in a classified model. These methods are time-consuming and difficult for practical clinical practice application. For this reason this paper proposes an improved object detection method for automatic mitosis detection from histological images. First we use a convolutional neural network CNN to automatically extract mitosis features. Then we use the region proposed network RPN to locate a set of class-agnostic mitosis proposals. Finally we use the improved R-CNN subnet to screen for mitosis from these proposals. Our approach achieved the best results in the ICPR2012 mitosis detection competition test dataset. Additionally our proposed method is fast enough to be potentially used in clinical and health centers. An Improved Object Detection Method for Mitosis Detection.
