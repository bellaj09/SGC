Multimode fibers MMFs are an example of a highly scattering medium which scramble the coherent light propagating within them to produce seemingly random patterns. Thus for applications such as imaging and image projection through an MMF careful measurements of the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the fiber are required. We show as a proof of concept that a deep neural network can learn the input-output relationship in a 0.75\u2009m long MMF. Specifically we demonstrate that a deep convolutional neural network CNN can learn the nonlinear relationships between the amplitude of the speckle pattern phase information lost obtained at the output of the fiber and the phase or the amplitude at the input of the fiber. Effectively the network performs a nonlinear inversion task. We obtained image fidelities correlations as high as ~98% for reconstruction and ~94% for image projection in the MMF compared with the image recovered using the full knowledge of the system transmission characterized with the complex measured matrix. We further show that the network can be trained for transfer learning i.e. it can transmit images through the MMF which belongs to another class not used for training/testing.
