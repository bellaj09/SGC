In contemporary surgical clinical practice spinal instability is often treated with mechanical stabilization techniques in order to protect the spinal cord and nerve roots. These techniques involve placing screws in defined regions of the vertebrae typically the pedicle where the strongest bone is found. The challenge for the surgeon is the accurate placement of screws for good mechanical purchase and to avoid damage to surrounding vital anatomical structures. This is especially critical in the cervical region where the target bone mass is smaller and the spinal cord nerve roots and vertebral arteries are all at risk. A robotic system enabling the surgeon to precisely place implants into the vertebrae should enhance safety and may potentially improve surgical results. Robotic system for cervical spine surgery.
