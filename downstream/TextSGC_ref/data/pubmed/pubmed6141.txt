An encephalogram EEG is a commonly used ancillary test to aide in the diagnosis of epilepsy. The EEG signal contains information about the electrical activity of the brain. Traditionally neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. This technique can be time-consuming limited by technical artifact provides variable results secondary to reader expertise level and is limited in identifying abnormalities. Therefore it is essential to develop a computer-aided diagnosis CAD system to automatically distinguish the class of these EEG signals using machine learning techniques. This is the first study to employ the convolutional neural network CNN for analysis of EEG signals. In this work a 13-layer deep convolutional neural network CNN algorithm is implemented to detect normal preictal and seizure classes. The proposed technique achieved an accuracy specificity and sensitivity of 88.67% 90.00% and 95.00% respectively. Deep convolutional neural network for the automated detection and diagnosis of seizure using EEG signals.
