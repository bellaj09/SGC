"Medical imaging is a vital part of the clinical decision-making process especially in an oncological setting. Radiology has experienced a great wave of change and the advent of quantitative imaging has provided a unique opportunity to analyse patient images objectively. Leveraging radiomics and deep learning there is increased potential for synergy between physicians and computer networks-via computer-aided diagnosis CAD computer-aided prediction of response CARP and computer-aided biological profiling CABP. The ongoing digitalization of other specialties further opens the door for even greater multidisciplinary integration. We envision the development of an integrated system composed of an aggregation of sub-systems interoperating with the aim of achieving an overarching functionality in this case better CAD CARP and CABP. This will require close multidisciplinary cooperation among the clinicians biomedical scientists and bioengineers as well as an administrative framework where the departments will operate not in isolation but in successful harmony. KEY POINTS:  The advent of quantitative imaging provides a unique opportunity to analyse patient images objectively.  Radiomics and deep learning allow for a more detailed overview of the tumour i.e. CAD CARP and CABP from many different perspectives.  As it currently stands different medical disciplines have developed different stratification methods primarily based on their own field-often to the exclusion of other departments.  The digitalization of other specialties further opens the door for multidisciplinary integration.  The long-term vision for precision medicine should focus on the development of integration strategies wherein data derived from the patients themselves via multiple disciplines can be used to guide clinical decisions."
