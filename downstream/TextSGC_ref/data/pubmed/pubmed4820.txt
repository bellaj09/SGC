Many neurological and psychiatric diseases in humans are caused by disruptions to large-scale functional properties of the brain including functional connectivity. There has been growing interest in discovering the functional organization of brain networks in larger animal models. As a result the use of translational pig models in neuroscience has significantly increased in the past decades. The gyrencephalic pig brain resembles the human brain more in anatomy growth and development than the brains of commonly used small laboratory animals such as rodents. In this work resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging rs-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging DTI data were acquired from a group of pigs n\u2009=\u200912. rs-fMRI data were analyzed for resting-state networks RSNs by using independent component analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Six RSNs executive control cerebellar sensorimotor visual auditory and default mode were detected that resemble their counterparts in human brains as measured by Pearson spatial correlations and mean ratios. Supporting evidence of the validity of these RSNs was provided through the evaluation and quantification of structural connectivity measures mean diffusivity fractional anisotropy fiber length and fiber density estimated from the DTI data. This study shows that as a translational large animal model pigs demonstrate great potential for mapping connectome-scale functional connectivity in experimental modeling of human brain disorders. Pig Brains Have Homologous Resting-State Networks with Human Brains.
