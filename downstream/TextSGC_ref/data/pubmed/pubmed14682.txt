Microscopy is a central method in life sciences. Many popular methods such as antibody labeling are used to add physical fluorescent labels to specific cellular constituents. However these approaches have significant drawbacks including inconsistency; limitations in the number of simultaneous labels because of spectral overlap; and necessary perturbations of the experiment such as fixing the cells to generate the measurement. Here we show that a computational machine-learning approach which we call "in silico labeling" ISL reliably predicts some fluorescent labels from transmitted-light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples. ISL predicts a range of labels such as those for nuclei cell type e.g. neural and cell state e.g. cell death. Because prediction happens in silico the method is consistent is not limited by spectral overlap and does not disturb the experiment. ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire. In Silico Labeling: Predicting Fluorescent Labels in Unlabeled Images.
