The recent explosion of artificial intelligence techniques in video analytics has highlighted the clinical relevance in capturing and quantifying semiology during epileptic seizures; however we lack an automated anomaly identification system for aberrant behaviors. In this paper we describe a novel system that is trained with known clinical manifestations from patients with mesial temporal and extra-temporal lobe epilepsy and presents aberrant semiology to physicians. Aberrant epileptic seizure identification: A computer vision perspective.
