The capabilities and applications of the Dextrous Anthropomorphic Robotic Testbed DART in geologic exploration on the Moon and Mars are described. The article also describes a simulation of planetary exploration using a DART robot and Full Immersion Telepresence Testbed FITT gear worn by a human. The FITT apparatus allows a human "master" to control movement in the DART "slave". The simulation focused on the robot\s ability to use fine motor coordination to manipulate geologic field tools. Virtual presence: one step beyond reality.
