The dentato-rubro-thalamic tract DRTT regulates motor control connecting the cerebellum to the thalamus. This tract is modulated by deep-brain stimulation in the surgical treatment of medically refractory tremor especially in essential tremor where high-frequency stimulation of the thalamus can improve symptoms. The DRTT is classically described as a decussating pathway ascending to the contralateral thalamus. However the existence of a nondecussating i.e. ipsilateral DRTT in humans was recently demonstrated and these tracts are arranged in distinct regions of the superior cerebellar peduncle. We hypothesized that the ipsilateral DRTT is connected to specific thalamic nuclei and therefore may have unique functional relevance. The goals of this study were to confirm the presence of the decussating and nondecussating DRTT pathways identify thalamic termination zones of each tract and compare whether structural connectivity findings agree with functional connectivity. Diffusion-weighted imaging was used to perform probabilistic tractography of the decussating and nondecussating DRTT in young healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project n\u202f=\u202f91 scanned using multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging 270 directions; TR/TE\u202f=\u202f5500/89\u202fms; spatial resolution\u202f=\u202f1.25\u202fmm isotropic. To define thalamic anatomical landmarks a segmentation procedure based on the Morel Atlas was employed and DRTT targeting was quantified based on the proportion of streamlines arriving at each nucleus. In parallel functional connectivity analysis was performed using resting-state functional MRI TR/TE\u202f=\u202f720/33\u202fms; spatial resolution\u202f=\u202f2\u202fmm isotropic. It was found that the decussating and nondecussating DRTTs have significantly different thalamic endpoints with the former preferentially targeting relatively anterior and lateral thalamic nuclei and the latter connected to more posterior and medial nuclei p\u202f<\u202f0.001. Functional and structural connectivity measures were found to be significantly correlated r\u202f=\u202f0.45 p\u202f=\u202f0.031. These findings provide new insight into pathways through which unilateral cerebellum can exert bilateral influence on movement and raise questions about the functional implications of ipsilateral cerebellar efferents.
