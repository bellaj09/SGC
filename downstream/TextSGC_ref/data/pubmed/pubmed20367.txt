Water has a unique touch as well as characteristic physical properties. However nobody knows the real identity of its touch. Here we show that water creates a stick-slip feel when a small amount is rubbed using fingertip on an artificial skin that mimics the structure of human skin. The results of frictional analyses predict that this stick-slip feel is caused by a drastic change in frictional resistance. The present result is valuable for biologists and robot engineers as well as cognitive scientists and tribologists because it is a new example of stick-slip phenomena on biological surfaces. The tactile texture of this most familiar material could also be applied to consumer products or virtual reality systems. Tactile impression and friction of water on human skin.
