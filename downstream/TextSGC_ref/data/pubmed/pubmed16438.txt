Impairments of executive functions EF significantly affect the ability to lead an independent lifestyle. Virtual environments offer a way to rehabilitate EF due to their ecological validity. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of a virtual reality VR supermarket VMall for treatment of EF in patients with Traumatic Brain Injury TBI compared to conventional occupational therapy OT in order to provide initial data regarding the effect sizes for calculation of sample size as well as to establish an intervention protocol for future Randomized Control Trials RCTs. Twelve men and women aged 19-55 years who had TBI resulting in EF impairments participated in this study. Outcome measures were the Multiple Errands Test-Simplified Version MET-SV and the Executive Function Performance Test EFPT. Cognitive treatment provided to both groups was based on the same principles; the participants in the experimental group received 10 45-min VR-based treatment sessions and the control group participants received 10 sessions of occupational therapy cognitive retraining without VR. Baseline performance prior to intervention showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Most participants improved their performance after therapy. Following a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons no significant between or within group differences were found Nevertheless large effect sizes 0.51 for the percent % relative change of the MET-SV total score and EFPT total score after intervention were high in favor of the experimental group indicating a larger improvement in EF. Based on this pilot study results show a trend towards an advantage to VR therapy compared to cognitive retraining OT without VR as it leads to greater improvement in complex everyday activities.
