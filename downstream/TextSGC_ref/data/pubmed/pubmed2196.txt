On March 11 2020 the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 a pandemic 1. As of March 28 2020 a total of 571678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26494 deaths have been reported worldwide 2. Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions 34. U.S. older adults including those aged 65 years and particularly those aged 85 years also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; however data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported 5. As of March 28 2020 U.S. states and territories have reported 122653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC including 7162 5.8% for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. Among these 7162 cases 2692 37.6% patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor and 4470 62.4% had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit ICU admission 358 of 457 78% and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission 732 of 1037 71% than that among those who were not hospitalized 1388 of 5143 27%. The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease. These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.
