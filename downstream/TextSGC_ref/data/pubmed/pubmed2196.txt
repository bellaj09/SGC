The dysconnectivity theory of schizophrenia proposes that schizophrenia symptoms arise from abnormalities in neuronal synchrony. Resting-state Functional Connectivity FC techniques allow us to highlight synchronization of large-scale networks the Resting-state Networks RNs. A large body of work suggests that disruption of RN synchronization could give rise to specific schizophrenia symptoms. The present study aimed to explore within- and between-network FC strength of 34 RNs in 29 patients suffering from schizophrenia and their relationships with schizophrenia symptoms. Resting-state data were analyzed using independent component analysis and dual-regression techniques. Our results showed that both within-RN and between-RN FC were disrupted in patients with schizophrenia with a global trend toward weaker FC. This decrease affected more particularly visual auditory and crossmodal binding networks. These alterations were correlated with negative symptoms positive symptoms and hallucinations indicating abnormalities in visual processing and crossmodal binding in schizophrenia. Moreover we stressed an anomalous synchronization between a visual network and a network thought to be engaged in mental imaging processes correlated with delusions and hallucinations. Altogether our results supported the assumption that some schizophrenia symptoms may be related to low-order sensory alterations impacting higher-order cognitive processes i.e. the "bottom-up" hypothesis of schizophrenia symptoms. Network modeling of resting state connectivity points towards the bottom up theories of schizophrenia.
