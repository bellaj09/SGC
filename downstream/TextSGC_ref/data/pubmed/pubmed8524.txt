Despite the effective application of deep learning DL in brain-computer interface BCI systems the successful execution of this technique especially for inter-subject classification in cognitive BCI has not been accomplished yet. In this paper we propose a framework based on the deep convolutional neural network CNN to detect the attentive mental state from single-channel raw electroencephalography EEG data. Inter-subject transfer learning with an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCI.
