The assessment of tissue compliance using a handheld tool is an important skill in medical areas such as laparoscopic and dental surgery. The increasing prevalence of virtual reality devices raises the question of whether we can exploit these systems to accelerate the training of compliance discrimination in trainee surgeons. We used a haptic feedback device and stylus to assess the abilities of nave participants to detect compliance differences with and without knowledge of results KR groups 1 and 2 as well as the abilities of participants who had undergone repetitive training over several days group 3. Kinematic analyses were carried out to objectively measure the probing action. Untrained participants had poor detection thresholds mean just noticeable difference JND = 33% and we found no effect of KR provided after each trial on performance mean JND = 35%. Intensive training dramatically improved group performance mean JND = 12%. Probing action in particular slower movement execution was associated with better detection thresholds but training did not lead to systematic changes in probing behaviour. These findings set a benchmark for training systems that act to increase perceptual sensitivity and guide the learner toward optimal movement strategies to improve discrimination. Can virtual reality trainers improve the compliance discrimination abilities of trainee surgeons?
