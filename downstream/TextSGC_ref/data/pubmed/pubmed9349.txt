Drug-target interactions DTIs play a crucial role in target-based drug discovery and development. Computational prediction of DTIs can effectively complement experimental wet-lab techniques for the identification of DTIs which are typically time- and resource-consuming. However the performances of the current DTI prediction approaches suffer from a problem of low precision and high false-positive rate. In this study we aim to develop a novel DTI prediction method for improving the prediction performance based on a cascade deep forest CDF model named DTI-CDF with multiple similarity-based features between drugs and the similarity-based features between target proteins extracted from the heterogeneous graph which contains known DTIs. In the experiments we built five replicates of 10-fold cross-validation under three different experimental settings of data sets namely corresponding DTI values of certain drugs SD targets ST or drug-target pairs SP in the training sets are missed but existed in the test sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach DTI-CDF achieves a significantly higher performance than that of the traditional ensemble learning-based methods such as random forest and XGBoost deep neural network and the state-of-the-art methods such as DDR. Furthermore there are 1352 newly predicted DTIs which are proved to be correct by KEGG and DrugBank databases.
