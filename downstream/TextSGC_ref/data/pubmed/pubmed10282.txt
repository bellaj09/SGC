Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy cryo-EM has become a powerful technique for determining 3D structures of biological macromolecules at near-atomic resolution. However this approach requires picking huge numbers of macromolecular particle images from thousands of low-contrast high-noisy electron micrographs. Although machine-learning methods were developed to get rid of this bottleneck it still lacks universal methods that could automatically picking the noisy cryo-EM particles of various macromolecules. Deep-learning with synthetic data enables automated picking of cryo-EM particle images of biological macromolecules.
