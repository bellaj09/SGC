Thanks to the development of computers and telecommunication the concept of communication is undergoing radical changes. Scientific collaboration among medical professionals has evolved rapidly in the last few years toward the use of Internet a new tool which will change the world of health. It is impossible to predict at present where this new type of scientific collaboration will lead us but what is certain is that in the next decade the so-called electronic communities will be created and will develop at an extraordinary rate. The increase in the capacity of image processing in computers and in the rate of transmission of data over the net will make possible applications such as the remote medical visit video conferences surgical simulation or even remote virtual surgery. However while some medical professionals are dreaming of this type of electronic communication in the future others are using it right now taking advantage of all of its benefits. In fact electronic communities are already a reality being accessible today and not a future goal. Being inside or outside these communities will make the difference between health professionals. It is well worth therefore being in contact with these new fields so as not to miss the boat of technological development. We present a comprehensive listing of neurosurgical resources available on the Internet and some ideas on the present and future applications of the Internet in the world of Health Care. Neurosurgery and the Internet: a critical analysis and a review of available resources.
