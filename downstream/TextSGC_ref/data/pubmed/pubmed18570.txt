Does the learning of a balance and stability skill exhibit time-course phases and transfer limitations characteristic of the acquisition and consolidation of voluntary movement sequences? Here we followed the performance of young adults trained in maintaining balance while standing on a moving platform synchronized with a virtual reality road travel scene. The training protocol included eight 3 min long iterations of the road scene. Center of Pressure CoP displacements were analyzed for each task iteration within the training session as well as during tests at 24h 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-training to test for consolidation phase "offline" gains and assess retention. In addition CoP displacements in reaction to external perturbations were assessed before and after the training session and in the 3 subsequent post-training assessments stability tests. There were significant reductions in CoP displacements as experience accumulated within session with performance stabilizing by the end of the session. However CoP displacements were further reduced at 24h post-training delayed "offline" gains and these gains were robustly retained. There was no transfer of the practice-related gains to performance in the stability tests. The time-course of learning the balance maintenance task as well as the limitation on generalizing the gains to untrained conditions are in line with the results of studies of manual movement skill learning. The current results support the conjecture that a similar repertoire of basic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity may underlay skill procedural "how to" knowledge acquisition and skill memory consolidation in voluntary and balance maintenance tasks. Balance maintenance as an acquired motor skill: Delayed gains and robust retention after a single session of training in a virtual environment.
