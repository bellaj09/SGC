Enhancing motor imagery MI results in amplified event-related desynchronization ERD and is important for MI-based rehabilitation and brain-computer interface BCI applications. Many attempts to enhance the MI by providing a visual guidance have been reported. We believe that the rubber hand illusion RHI which induces body ownership over an external object can provide better guidance to enhance MI; thus an RHI-based paradigm with motorized moving rubber hand was proposed. To validate the proposed MI enhancing paradigm we conducted an experimental comparison among paradigms with 20 healthy subjects. The peak amplitude and arrival times of ERD were compared at contralateral and ipsilateral electroencephalogram channels. We found significantly amplified ERD caused by the proposed paradigm which is similar to the ERD caused by motor execution. In addition the arrival time suggests that the proposed paradigm is applicable for BCI. In conclusion the proposed paradigm can significantly enhance the MI with better characteristics for use with BCI.
