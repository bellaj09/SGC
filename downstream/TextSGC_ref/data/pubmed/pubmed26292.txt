"Cortical stimulation through electrocorticographic ECoG electrodes is a potential method for providing sensory feedback in future prosthetic and rehabilitative applications. Here we evaluate human subjects ability to continuously modulate their motor behavior based on feedback from direct surface stimulation of the somatosensory cortex. Subjects wore a dataglove that measured their hand aperture position and received one of three stimuli over the hand sensory cortex based on their current hand position as compared to a target aperture position. Using cortical stimulation feedback subjects adjusted their hand aperture to move towards the target aperture region. One subject was able to achieve accuracies and R2 values well above chance best performance: R2 = 0.93; accuracy = 0.76/1. Performance dropped during the catch trial same stimulus independent of the position to below chance levels suggesting that the subject had been using the varied sensory feedback to modulate their motor behavior. To our knowledge this study represents one of the first demonstrations of using direct cortical surface stimulation of the human sensory cortex to perform a motor task and is a first step towards developing closed-loop human sensorimotor brain-computer interfaces."
