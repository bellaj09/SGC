Visualization from trained deep neural networks has drawn massive public attention in recent. One of the visualization approaches is to train images maximizing the activation of specific neurons. However directly maximizing the activation would lead to unrecognizable images which cannot provide any meaningful information. In this paper we introduce a simple but effective technique to constrain the optimization route of the visualization. By adding two totally inverse transformations image blurring and deblurring to the optimization procedure recognizable images can be created. Our algorithm is good at extracting the details in the images which are usually filtered by previous methods in the visualizations. Extensive experiments on AlexNet VGGNet and GoogLeNet illustrate that we can better understand the neural networks utilizing the knowledge obtained by the visualization.
