Accurately predicted contacts allow to compute the 3D structure of a protein. Since the solution space of native residue-residue contact pairs is very large it is necessary to leverage information to identify relevant regions of the solution space i.e. correct contacts. Every additional source of information can contribute to narrowing down candidate regions. Therefore recent methods combined evolutionary and sequence-based information as well as evolutionary and physicochemical information. We develop a new contact predictor EPSILON-CP that goes beyond current methods by combining evolutionary physicochemical and sequence-based information. The problems resulting from the increased dimensionality and complexity of the learning problem are combated with a careful feature analysis which results in a drastically reduced feature set. The different information sources are combined using deep neural networks. EPSILON-CP: using deep learning to combine information from multiple sources for protein contact prediction.
