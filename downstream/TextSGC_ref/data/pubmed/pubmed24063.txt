Aging along with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus T2DM is a risk factor for the development of mild cognitive impairment MCI among older adults. Physical activity is found beneficial for improving the cognitive status among adults with MCI and in even those having dementia. Combined aerobic-cognitive interventions are an engaging substitute or add-on to existing pharmacological management regimens. A 76-year diabetic male having MCI followed 12 weeks of aerobics-virtual reality VR-based cognitive training programme 3days/week. The session comprised of 30 minutes of interactive gaming via xbox-360 Kinect followed by the aerobic phase of 30 minutes using stationary cycle maintaining the intensity of 40-60% of heart rate reserve HRR. The cognitive testing included tools for assessing global cognition and executive function. Random plasma glucose level was also noted at baseline after 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-interventions while vitals including pulse rate oxygen saturation and blood pressure were documented at baseline and at the end of intervension. Results depict that 12 weeks of aerobic-VR training was effective in improving the cognitive status along with random plasma glucose levels of the patient.
