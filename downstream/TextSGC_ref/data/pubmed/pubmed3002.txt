The present study describes the ipsilateral and contralateral corticocortical and corticothalamic connectivity of the occipital visual areas 17 18 19 and 21 in the ferret using standard anatomical tract-tracing methods. In line with previous studies of mammalian visual cortex connectivity substantially more anterograde and retrograde label was present in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injection site compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Ipsilateral reciprocal connectivity was the strongest within the occipital visual areas while weaker connectivity strength was observed in the temporal suprasylvian and parietal visual areas. Callosal connectivity tended to be strongest in the homotopic cortical areas and revealed a similar areal distribution to that observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere although often less widespread across cortical areas. Ipsilateral reciprocal connectivity was observed throughout the visual nuclei of the dorsal thalamus with no contralateral connections to the visual thalamus being observed. The current study along with previous studies of connectivity in the cat identified the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian visual area PMLS as a distinct network hub external to the occipital visual areas in carnivores implicating PMLS as a potential gateway to the parietal cortex for dorsal stream processing. These data will also contribute to a macro connectome database of the ferret brain providing essential data for connectomics analyses and cross-species analyses of connectomes and brain connectivity matrices as well as providing data relevant to additional studies of cortical connectivity across mammals and the evolution of cortical connectivity variation.
