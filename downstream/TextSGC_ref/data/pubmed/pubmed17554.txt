This research aims at the process of three-dimensional3D reconstruction from medical body data using VRML and VC++ JavaScript language and focuses on the application of VRML for 3D reconstruction of medical digital images. The 2D medical digital images firstly are modified in VC++ language. Then the images are manipulated by mould built in VRML and modified in JavaScript language. Finally the 3D reconstruction of body internal organs can be formed in high quality near to those got in traditional methods. Furthermore VRML browser can offer better windows of man-computer interaction in real time environment. As a new method and tool quite different from traditional ways of 3D reconstruction VRML is useful for the visualization of medical 3D reconstruction based on 2D images and has a promising prospect in the field of medical image. Application of virtual reality modeling language in the fields of medical digital image.
