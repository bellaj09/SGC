The array of available brain-computer interface BCI paradigms has continued to grow and so has the corresponding set of machine learning methods which are at the core of BCI systems. The latter have evolved to provide more robust data analysis solutions and as a consequence the proportion of healthy BCI users who can use a BCI successfully is growing. With this development the chances have increased that the needs and abilities of specific patients the end-users can be covered by an existing BCI approach. However most end-users who have experienced the use of a BCI system at all have encountered a single paradigm only. This paradigm is typically the one that is being tested in the study that the end-user happens to be enrolled in along with other end-users. Though this corresponds to the preferred study arrangement for basic research it does not ensure that the end-user experiences a working BCI. In this study a different approach was taken; that of a user-centered design. It is the prevailing process in traditional assistive technology. Given an individual user with a particular clinical profile several available BCI approaches are tested and - if necessary - adapted to him/her until a suitable BCI system is found.
