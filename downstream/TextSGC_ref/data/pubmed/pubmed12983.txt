Biological collagenous tissues comprised of networks of collagen fibers are suitable for a broad spectrum of medical applications owing to their attractive mechanical properties. In this study we developed a noninvasive approach to estimate collagenous tissue elastic properties directly from microscopy images using Machine Learning ML techniques. Glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium GLBP tissue widely used in the fabrication of bioprosthetic heart valves and vascular patches was chosen to develop a representative application. A Deep Learning model was designed and trained to process second harmonic generation SHG images of collagen networks in GLBP tissue samples and directly predict the tissue elastic mechanical properties. The trained model is capable of identifying the overall tissue stiffness with a classification accuracy of 84% and predicting the nonlinear anisotropic stress-strain curves with average regression errors of 0.021 and 0.031. Thus this study demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the Deep Learning approach for fast and noninvasive assessment of collagenous tissue elastic properties from microstructural images.
