Stereotactic radiosurgery SRS serves as a standard of care of brain metastases BMs however the BMs delineation in the SRS workflow can be time-consuming. The manual contouring can be a pronounced bottleneck in multiple BMs but there is a lack of tools for automatic delineation and quantitative evaluation. In this study based on our previous developed deep learning-based segmentation algorithms we developed a web-based automated BMs segmentation and labeling platform to assist the SRS clinical workflow. A Web-based Brain Metastases Segmentation and Labeling Platform for Stereotactic Radiosurgery.
