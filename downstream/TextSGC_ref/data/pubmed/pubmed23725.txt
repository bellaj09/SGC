Drug discovery and design are fundamental to drug development. Until recently most drugs were discovered through random screening or developed through molecular modification. New technologies are revolutionizing this phase of drug development. Rational drug design using powerful computers and computational chemistry and employing X-ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship analysis is creating highly specific biologically active molecules by virtual reality modeling. Sophisticated screening technologies are eliminating all but the most active lead compounds. These new technologies promise more efficacious safe and cost-effective medications while minimizing drug development time and maximizing profits.
