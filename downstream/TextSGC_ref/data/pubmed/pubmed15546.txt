Virtual reality VR is now commonly used in many domains because of its ability to provide a standardized reproducible and controllable environment. In balance assessment it can be used to control stimuli presented to patients and thus accurately evaluate their progression or compare them to different populations in standardized situations. In balance rehabilitation VR allows the creation of new generation tools and at the same time the means to assess the efficiency of each parameter of these tools in order to optimize them. Moreover with the development of low-cost devices this rehabilitation can be continued at home making access to these tools much easier in addition to their entertaining and thus motivating properties. Nevertheless and even more with low-cost systems VR has limits that can alter the results of the studies that use it: the latency of the system the delay cumulated on each step of the process from data acquisition on the patients to multimodal outputs; and distance perception which tends to be underestimated in VR. After having described why VR is an essential tool for balance assessment and rehabilitation and illustrated this statement with a case study this review discusses the previous works in the domain with regards to the technological limits of VR. Advantages and limitations of virtual reality for balance assessment and rehabilitation.
