Estimating directions of arrival DOA without knowledge of the source number is regarded as a challenging task particularly when coherence among sources exists. Researchers have trained deep learning DL-based models to attack the problem of DOA estimation. However existing DL-based methods for coherent sources do not adapt to variable source numbers or require signal independence. Herein we put forward a new framework combining parallel DOA estimators with Toeplitz matrix reconstruction to address the problem. Each estimator is constructed by connecting a multi-label classifier to a spatial filter which is based on convolutional-recurrent neural networks. Spatial filters divide the angle domain into several sectors so that the following classifiers can extract the arrival directions. Assisted with Toeplitz-based method for source-number determination pseudo or missed angles classified by the estimators will be reduced. Then the spatial spectrum can be more accurately recovered. In addition the proposed method is data-driven so it is naturally immune to signal coherence. Simulation results demonstrate the predominance of the proposed method and show that the trained model is robust to imperfect circumstances such as limited snapshots colored Gaussian noise and array imperfections.
