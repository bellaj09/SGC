Brain-machine interfaces BMI rely on the accurate classification of event-related potentials ERPs and their performance greatly depends on the appropriate selection of classifier parameters and features from dense-array electroencephalography EEG signals. Moreover in order to achieve a portable and more compact BMI for practical applications it is also desirable to use a system capable of accurate classification using information from as few EEG channels as possible. In the present work we propose a method for classifying P300 ERPs using a combination of Fisher Discriminant Analysis FDA and a multiobjective hybrid real-binary Particle Swarm Optimization MHPSO algorithm. Specifically the algorithm searches for the set of EEG channels and classifier parameters that simultaneously maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the number of used channels. The performance of the method is assessed through offline analyses on datasets of auditory ERPs from sound discrimination experiments. The proposed method achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by traditional methods while also using fewer channels. It was also found that the number of channels used for classification can be significantly reduced without greatly compromising the classification accuracy.
