Finding non-coding RNA ncRNA genes has emerged over the past few years as a cutting-edge trend in bioinformatics. There are numerous computational intelligence CI challenges in the annotation and interpretation of ncRNAs because it requires a domain-related expert knowledge in CI techniques. Moreover there are many classes predicted yet not experimentally verified by researchers. Recently researchers have applied many CI methods to predict the classes of ncRNAs. However the diverse CI approaches lack a definitive classification framework to take advantage of past studies. A few review papers have attempted to summarize CI approaches but focused on the particular methodological viewpoints. Accordingly in this article we summarize in greater detail than previously available the CI techniques for finding ncRNAs genes. We differentiate from the existing bodies of research and discuss concisely the technical merits of various techniques. Lastly we review the limitations of ncRNA gene-finding CI methods with a point-of-view towards the development of new computational tools. A Review of Computational Methods for Finding Non-Coding RNA Genes.
