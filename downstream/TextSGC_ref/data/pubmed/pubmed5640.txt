Neuroimaging studies provide information useful to understand the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome. Molecular PET and SPECT imaging findings mainly supported dysfunction of dopaminergic pathways involving not only the nigrostriatal but also mesolimbic pathways. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies have used different techniques. Studies using iron-sensitive sequences supported the presence of a regionally variable low brain iron content mainly at the level of substantia nigra and thalamus. The search for brain structural or microstructural abnormalities by voxel-based morphometry diffusion tensor imaging or cortical thickness analysis has reported none or variable findings in restless legs syndrome patients most of them in regions belonging to sensorimotor and limbic/nociceptive networks. Functional MRI studies have substantially demonstrated activation or connectivity changes in the same networks. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies showed metabolic changes in the thalamus which is a hub of these networks. In summary neuroimaging findings in restless legs syndrome support the presence of reduction of brain iron content of dysfunction of mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and of abnormalities at level of limbic/nociceptive and sensorimotor networks.
