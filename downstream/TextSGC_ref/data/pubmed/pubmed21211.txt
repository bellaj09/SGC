In recent years 3-dimensional 3D simulation of neurosurgical procedures has become increasingly popular as an addition to training programmes. However there remains little objective evidence of its effectiveness in improving live surgical skill. This review analysed the current literature in 3D neurosurgical simulation highlighting remaining gaps in the evidence base for improvement in surgical performance and suggests useful future research directions. The Effect of 3-Dimensional Simulation on Neurosurgical Skill Acquisition and Surgical Performance: A Review of the Literature.
