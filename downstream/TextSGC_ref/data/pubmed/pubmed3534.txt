Resting-state connectivity for example based on magnetoencephalography MEG or electroencephalography EEG is a widely used method for characterizing brain networks and a promising imaging biomarker. However there is no established standard as to which method modality and analysis variant is preferable and there is only limited knowledge on the reproducibility an important prerequisite for clinical application. We conducted an MEG-/high-density hd-EEG-study on 22 young healthy adults who were measured twice in a scan/rescan design after 7\u2009\u20092 days. Reliability of resting-state 15\u2009min eyes-closed connectivity in source space was calculated via intraclass correlation coefficient ICC in classical frequency bands delta-gamma. We investigated the reliability of two commonly used connectivity metrics namely the imaginary part of coherency and the weighted phase-lag index and the influence of frequency band vigilance and the number of trials. We found a strong increase of reliability with more trials and relatively mild effects of vigilance. Reliability was excellent in the alpha band for MEG as well as hd-EEG ICC >0.85; in the theta band reliability was good for MEG and poor for EEG. Other frequency bands showed lower reliability with delta band being the worst. Furthermore we investigated the spatial reliability of resting-state connectivity in a vertex-based approach which reached fair to good reliability ICC up to 0.67 with 5\u2009min of data. Our results indicate that excellent reliability of global connectivity is achievable in alpha band and vertex-based connectivity was still fair to good. Moreover electrophysiological resting-state studies could benefit from more data than used previously. MEG and hd-EEG were similar in their overall performance but showed frequency band-specific differences.
