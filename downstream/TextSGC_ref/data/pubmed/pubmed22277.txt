In boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD loss of upper limb function becomes more evident after the onset of wheelchair-dependency because of the inability to lift the arms against gravity.

Dynamic arm supports may enable boys with impaired arm function to train their muscles without becoming exhausted by providing external mechanical compensation for muscle weakness.
