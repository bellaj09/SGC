A Brain-computer interface BCI is a novel communication system that translates brain signals into a control signal. Now with the appearance of the commercial EEG headsets and mobile smart platforms tablet smartphone it is possible to develop the mobile BCI system which can greatly improve the life quality of patients suffering from motor disease such as amyotrophic lateral scleroses ALS multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy and head trauma. This study adopted a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC headset and Microsoft surface pro 3 to realize a dialing system which was represented by 43 matrices of alphanumeric characters. The performance of the online portable dialing system based on P300 is satisfying. The average classification accuracy reaches 88.7510.57% in lab and 73.7516.94% in metro while the information transfer rate ITR reaches 7.171.80 and 5.052.17 bits/min respectively. This means the commercial EEG headset and tablet has good prospect in developing real time BCI system in realistic environments. The portable P300 dialing system based on tablet and Emotiv Epoc headset.
