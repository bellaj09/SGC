Current large-scale approaches in neuroscience aim to unravel the complete connectivity map of specific neuronal circuits or even the entire brain. This emerging research discipline has been termed connectomics. Recombinant glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus RABV G has become an important tool for the investigation of neuronal connectivity in the brains of a variety of species. Neuronal infection with even a single RABV G particle results in high-level transgene expression revealing the fine-detailed morphology of all neuronal features-including dendritic spines axonal processes and boutons-on a brain-wide scale. This labeling is eminently suitable for subsequent post-hoc morphological analysis such as semiautomated reconstruction in 3D. Here we describe the use of a recently developed anterograde RABV G variant together with a retrograde RABV G for the investigation of projections both to and from a particular brain region. In addition to the automated reconstruction of a dendritic tree we also give as an example the volume measurements of axonal boutons following RABV G-mediated fluorescent marker expression. In conclusion RABV G variants expressing a combination of markers and/or tools for stimulating/monitoring neuronal activity used together with genetic or behavioral animal models promise important insights in the structure-function relationship of neural circuits.
