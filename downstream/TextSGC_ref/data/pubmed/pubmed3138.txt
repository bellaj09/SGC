"The personality trait neuroticism is a potent risk marker for psychopathology. Although the neurobiological basis remains unclear studies have suggested that alterations in connectivity may underlie it. Therefore the aim of the current study was to shed more light on the functional network organization in neuroticism. To this end we applied graph theory on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data in 120 women selected based on their neuroticism score. Binary and weighted brain-wide graphs were constructed to examine changes in the functional network structure and functional connectivity strength. Furthermore graphs were partitioned into modules to specifically investigate connectivity within and between functional subnetworks related to emotion processing and cognitive control. Subsequently complex network measures ie efficiency and modularity were calculated on the brain-wide graphs and modules and correlated with neuroticism scores. Compared with low neurotic individuals high neurotic individuals exhibited a whole-brain network structure resembling more that of a random network and had overall weaker functional connections. Furthermore in these high neurotic individuals functional subnetworks could be delineated less clearly and the majority of these subnetworks showed lower efficiency while the affective subnetwork showed higher efficiency. In addition the cingulo-operculum subnetwork demonstrated more ties with other functional subnetworks in association with neuroticism. In conclusion the neurotic brain has a less than optimal functional network organization and shows signs of functional disconnectivity. Moreover in high compared with low neurotic individuals emotion and salience subnetworks have a more prominent role in the information exchange while sensory-motor and cognitive control subnetworks have a less prominent role."
