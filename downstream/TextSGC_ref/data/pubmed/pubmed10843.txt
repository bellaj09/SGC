Elementary quantitative and qualitative aspects of consciousness are investigated conjointly from the biology neuroscience physic and mathematic point of view by the mean of a theory written with Bennequin that derives and extends information theory within algebraic topology. Information structures that accounts for statistical dependencies within n-body interacting systems are interpreted a la Leibniz as a monadic-panpsychic framework where consciousness is information and physical and arise from collective interactions. The electrodynamic intrinsic nature of consciousness sustained by an analogical code is illustrated by standard neuroscience and psychophysic results. It accounts for the diversity of the learning mechanisms including adaptive and homeostatic processes on multiple scales and details their expression within information theory. The axiomatization and logic of cognition are rooted in measure theory expressed within a topos intrinsic probabilistic constructive logic. Information topology provides a synthesis of the main models of consciousness Neural Assemblies Integrated Information Global Neuronal Workspace Free Energy Principle within a formal Gestalt theory an expression of information structures and patterns in correspondence with Galois cohomology and discrete symmetries. The methods provide new formalization of deep neural network with homologicaly imposed architecture applied to challenges in AI-machine learning.
