We demonstrate that a deep neural network can be trained to virtually refocus a two-dimensional fluorescence image onto user-defined three-dimensional 3D surfaces within the sample. Using this method termed Deep-Z we imaged the neuronal activity of a Caenorhabditis elegans worm in 3D using a time sequence of fluorescence images acquired at a single focal plane digitally increasing the depth-of-field by 20-fold without any axial scanning additional hardware or a trade-off of imaging resolution and speed. Furthermore we demonstrate that this approach can correct for sample drift tilt and other aberrations all digitally performed after the acquisition of a single fluorescence image. This framework also cross-connects different imaging modalities to each other enabling 3D refocusing of a single wide-field fluorescence image to match confocal microscopy images acquired at different sample planes. Deep-Z has the potential to improve volumetric imaging speed while reducing challenges relating to sample drift aberration and defocusing that are associated with standard 3D fluorescence microscopy.
