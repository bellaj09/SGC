"Parkinsons disease PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor clinical alterations among others. Postural problems have serious consequences for patients not only limiting their daily life but also increasing some risks like the risk of fall. Inadequate postural control and postural instability is a major problem in PD patients. A Virtual Motor Rehabilitation System VMR has been tested in patients with PD in the intervention period. Our purpose was to analyze the evolution\xa0of\xa0the spatial postural control during the intervention period to see if there are any changes caused precisely by this intervention."
