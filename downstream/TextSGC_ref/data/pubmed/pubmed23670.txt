The grocery shopping Virtual Reality Spatial Object-Location Test VRSOLT was developed to examine sex differences in spatial object-location memory in a 3D virtual environment that simulates the real world. Forty college students 20 males 20 females were tested on the VRSOLT as well as mental rotation and 2D object-location memory tasks. Both convergent and divergent validity was demonstrated. Males showed an advantage on mental rotation and results of the VRSOLT grocery store test replicated the female object-location advantage seen in 2D tests. A strategy of systematically navigating the environment may aid female encoding for object location. Sex differences in spatial object-location memory in a virtual grocery store.
