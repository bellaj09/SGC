"Real-time motion capture of the human arm in the home environment has many usecases such as video game and therapy applications. The required tracking can be based onoff-the-shelf Inertial Measurement Units IMUs with integrated three-axis accelerometers gyroscopesand magnetometers. However this usually requires a homogeneous magnetic field to correctfor orientation drift which is often not available inside buildings. In this paper RPMC RestPose Magnetometer-based drift Correction a novel method that is robust to long term drift inenvironments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields is presented. The sensor orientation is estimatedby integrating the angular velocity measured by the gyroscope and correcting drift around the pitchand roll axes with the acceleration information. This commonly leads to short term drift aroundthe gravitational axis. Here during the calibration phase the local magnetic field direction for eachsensor and its orientation relative to the inertial frame are recorded in a rest pose. It is assumed thatarm movements in free space are exhausting and require regular rest. A set of rules is used to detectwhen the user has returned to the rest pose to then correct for the drift that has occurred with themagnetometer. Optical validations demonstrated accurate root mean square error RMS = 6.1 lowlatency 61 ms tracking of the users wrist orientation in real time for a full hour of arm movements.The reduction in error relative to three alternative methods implemented for comparison was between82.5% and 90.7% for the same movement and environment. Therefore the proposed arm trackingmethod allows for the correction of orientation drift in an inhomogeneous magnetic field by exploitingthe users need for frequent rest."
