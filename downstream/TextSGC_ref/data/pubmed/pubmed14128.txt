Radiotherapy is the main treatment strategy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A major factor affecting radiotherapy outcome is the accuracy of target delineation. Target delineation is time-consuming and the results can vary depending on the experience of the oncologist. Using deep learning methods to automate target delineation may increase its efficiency. We used a modified deep learning model called U-Net to automatically segment and delineate tumor targets in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients were randomly divided into a training set 302 patients validation set 100 patients and test set 100 patients. The U-Net model was trained using labeled computed tomography images from the training set. The U-Net was able to delineate nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumors with an overall dice similarity coefficient of 65.86% for lymph nodes and 74.00% for primary tumor with respective Hausdorff distances of 32.10 and 12.85 mm. Delineation accuracy decreased with increasing cancer stage. Automatic delineation took approximately 2.6 hours compared to 3 hours using an entirely manual procedure. Deep learning models can therefore improve accuracy consistency and efficiency of target delineation in T stage but additional physician input may be required for lymph nodes.
