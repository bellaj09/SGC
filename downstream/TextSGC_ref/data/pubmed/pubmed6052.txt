"Information processing and storage underpins many biological processes of vital importance to organism survival. Like animals plants also acquire store and process environmental information relevant to their fitness and this is particularly evident in their decision-making. The control of plant organ growth and timing of their developmental transitions are carefully orchestrated by the collective action of many connected computing agents the cells in what could be addressed as distributed computation. Here we discuss some examples of biological information processing in plants with special interest in the connection to formal computational models drawn from theoretical frameworks. Research into biological processes with a computational perspective may yield new insights and provide a general framework for information processing across different substrates. This article is part of the theme issue Liquid brains solid brains: How distributed cognitive architectures process information."
