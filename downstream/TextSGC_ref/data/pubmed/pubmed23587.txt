This report surveys the state of the art in applications of virtual environments and related technologies for health care. Applications of these technologies are being developed for health care in the following areas: surgical procedures remote surgery or telepresence augmented or enhanced surgery and planning and simulation of procedures before surgery; medical therapy; preventive medicine and patient education; medical education and training; visualization of massive medical databases; skill enhancement and rehabilitation; and architectural design for health-care facilities. To date such applications have improved the quality of health care and in the future they will result in substantial cost savings. Tools that respond to the needs of present virtual environment systems are being refined or developed. However additional large-scale research is necessary in the following areas: user studies use of robots for telepresence procedures enhanced system reality and improved system functionality. Virtual reality for health care: a survey.
