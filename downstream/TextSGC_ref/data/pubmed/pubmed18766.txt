Increasing focus on patient safety makes it important to ensure surgical competency among surgeons before operating on patients. The objective was to gather validity evidence for a virtual-reality simulator test for robotic surgical skills and evaluate its potential as a training tool. Surgeons with varying experience in robotic surgery were recruited: novices zero procedures intermediates 1-50 experienced >\u200950. Five experienced surgeons rated five exercises on the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Participants were tested using the five exercises. Participants were invited back 3 times and completed a total of 10 attempts per exercise. The outcome was the average simulator performance score for the 5 exercises. 32 participants from 5 surgical specialties were included. 38 participants completed all 4 sessions. A moderate correlation between the average total score and robotic experience was identified for the first attempt Spearman r\u2009=\u20090.58; p\u2009=\u20090.0004. A difference in average total score was observed between novices and intermediates median score 61% IQR 52-66 vs. 83% IQR 75-91 adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.0001 as well as novices and experienced median score 61% IQR 52-66 vs. 80 IQR 69-85 adjusted p\u2009=\u20090.002. All three groups improved their performance between the 1st and 10th attempts p\u2009<\u20090.00. This study describes validity evidence for a virtual-reality simulator for basic robotic surgical skills which can be used for assessment of basic competency and as a training tool. However more validity evidence is needed before it can be used for certification or high-stakes assessment. Examining validity evidence for a simulation-based assessment tool for basic robotic surgical skills.
