Trigeminal neurinomas are the second most common intracranial neurinomas next to the vestibular neurinomas. Eighty-four patients with trigeminal neurinomas were treated between 2003 and 2007. There were 40 women and 44 men mean age 43 years. The most frequent symptoms were headache or numbness of the ipsilateral hemiface. There were 24 type A nine type B 45 type C and six type D tumors. Dextroscope virtual reality technology was used for preoperative planning in recent eight cases. Gross total resection was achieved in 63 patients. We found that the major impediments to complete removal were adherent to the brainstem and skull base vascular structure the frontotemporal approach with zygomatic or orbitozygomatic osteotomy or subtemporal approach could offer excellent exposure of the middle fossa and access to the posterior fossa and Dextroscope virtual reality technology was a very useful tool to identify surgical and anatomic nuances and enhance preoperative planning in trigeminal neurinomas resection.
