Prostate cancer is one of the most common male tumors. The increasing use of whole slide digital scanners has led to an enormous interest in the application of machine learning techniques to histopathological image classification. Here we introduce a novel family of morphological descriptors which extracted in the appropriate image space and combined with shallow and deep Gaussian process based classifiers improves early prostate cancer diagnosis. A new optical density granulometry-based descriptor for the classification of prostate histological images using shallow and deep Gaussian processes.
