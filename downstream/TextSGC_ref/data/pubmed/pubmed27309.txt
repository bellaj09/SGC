The speed of brain-computer interfaces BCI based on event-related potentials ERP is inherently limited by the commonly used one-stimulus paradigm. In this paper we introduce a novel paradigm that can increase the spelling speed by a factor of 2 thereby extending the one-stimulus paradigm to a two-stimulus paradigm. Two different stimuli a face and a symbol are presented at the same time superimposed on different characters and ERPs are classified using a multi-class classifier. Here we present the proof-of-principle that is achieved with healthy participants. Beyond maximum speed--a novel two-stimulus paradigm for brain-computer interfaces based on event-related potentials P300-BCI.
