Humans can easily classify different kinds of objects whereas it is quite difficult for computers. As a hot and difficult problem objects classification has been receiving extensive interests with broad prospects. Inspired by neuroscience deep learning concept is proposed. Convolutional neural network CNN as one of the methods of deep learning can be used to solve classification problem. But most of deep learning methods including CNN all ignore the human visual information processing mechanism when a person is classifying objects. Therefore in this paper inspiring the completed processing that humans classify different kinds of objects we bring forth a new classification method which combines visual attention model and CNN. Firstly we use the visual attention model to simulate the processing of human visual selection mechanism. Secondly we use CNN to simulate the processing of how humans select features and extract the local features of those selected areas. Finally not only does our classification method depend on those local features but also it adds the human semantic features to classify objects. Our classification method has apparently advantages in biology. Experimental results demonstrated that our method made the efficiency of classification improve significantly.
