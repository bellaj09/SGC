"Automated seizure detection from clinical EEG data can reduce the diagnosis time and facilitate targeting treatment for epileptic patients. However current detection approaches mainly rely on limited features manually designed by domain experts which are inflexible for the detection of a variety of patterns in a large amount of patients EEG data. Moreover conventional machine learning algorithms for seizure detection cannot accommodate multi-channel Electroencephalogram EEG data effectively which contains both temporal and spatial information. Recently deep learning technology has been widely applied to perform image processing tasks which could learns useful features from data and process multi-channel data automatically. To provide an effective system for automatic seizure detection we proposed a new three-dimensional 3D convolutional neural network CNN structure whose inputs are multi-channel EEG signals."
