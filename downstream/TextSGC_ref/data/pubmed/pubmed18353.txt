"Introducing computer games to the rehabilitation market led to development of numerous Virtual Reality VR training applications. Although VR has provided tremendous benefit to the patients and caregivers it has inherent limitations some of which might be solved by replacing it with Augmented Reality AR. The task of pick-and-place which is part of many activities of daily living ADLs is one of the major affected functions stroke patients mainly expect to recover. We developed an exercise consisting of moving an object between various points following a flash light that indicates the next target. The results show superior performance of subjects in spatial AR versus non-immersive VR setting. This could be due to the extraneous hand-eye coordination which exists in VR whereas it is eliminated in spatial AR." Comparing "pick and place" task in spatial Augmented Reality versus non-immersive Virtual Reality for rehabilitation setting.
