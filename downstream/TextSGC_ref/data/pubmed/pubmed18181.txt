Rapid prototyping RP or stereolithography is a new clinical application area which is used to obtain accurate three-dimensional physical replicas of complex anatomical structures. The aim of this study was to create tangible hard copies of the ethmoidal labyrinth air cells ELACs with stereolithographic biomodelling. The visible human dataset VHD was used as the input imaging data. The Surfdriver software package was applied to these images to reconstruct the ELACs as three-dimensional DXF data exchange file models. These models were post-processed in 3D-Doctor software for virtual reality modelling language VRML and STL Standard Triangulation Language formats. Stereolithographic replicas were manufactured in a rapid prototyping machine by using the STL format. The total number of ELACs was 21. The dimensions of the ELACs on the right and left sides were 52.91 x 13.00 x 28.68 mm and 53.79 x 12.42 x 28.55 mm respectively. The total volume of the ELACs was 4771.1003 mm3. The mean ELAC distance was 27.29 mm from the nasion and 71.09 mm from the calotte topologically. In conclusion the combination of Surfdriver and 3D-Doctor could be effectively used for manufacturing 3D solid models from serial sections of anatomical structures. Stereolithographic anatomical models provide an innovative and complementary tool for students researchers and surgeons to apprehend these anatomical structures tangibly. The outcomes of these attempts can provide benefits in terms of the visualization perception and interpretation of the structures in anatomy teaching and prior to surgical interventions.
