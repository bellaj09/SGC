"Electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes embedded in the process of cellular respiration which is an important process to transfer electrons and other macromolecules throughout the cell. It is also the major process to extract energy via redox reactions in the case of oxidation of sugars. Many studies have determined that the electron transport protein has been implicated in a variety of human diseases i.e. diabetes Parkinson Alzheimers disease and so on. Few bioinformatics studies have been conducted to identify the electron transport proteins with high accuracy however their performance results require a lot of improvements. Here we present a novel deep neural network architecture to address this problem." ET-GRU: using multi-layer gated recurrent units to identify electron transport proteins.
