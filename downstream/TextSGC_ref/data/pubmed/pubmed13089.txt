Transcriptome in brain plays a crucial role in understanding the cortical organization and the development of brain structure and function. Two challenges incomplete data and high dimensionality of transcriptome remain unsolved. Here we present a novel training scheme that successfully adapts the U-net architecture to the problem of volume recovery. By analogy to denoising autoencoder we hide a portion of each training sample so that the network can learn to recover missing voxels from context. Then on the completed volumes we show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines RBMs can be used to infer co-occurrences among voxels providing foundations for dividing the cortex into discrete subregions. As we stack multiple RBMs to form a deep belief network DBN we progressively map the high-dimensional raw input into abstract representations and create a hierarchy of transcriptome architecture. A coarse to fine organization emerges from the network layers. This organization incidentally corresponds to the anatomical structures suggesting a close link between structures and the genetic underpinnings. Thus we demonstrate a new way of learning transcriptome-based hierarchical organization using RBM and DBN. Deep Neural Networks for In Situ Hybridization Grid Completion and Clustering.
