Microscopic fluorescence imaging serves as a basic tool in many research areas including biology medicine and chemistry. With the help of optical clearing large volume imaging of a mouse brain and even a whole body has been enabled. However constrained by the physical principles of optical imaging volume imaging has to balance imaging resolution and speed. Here we develop a new to the best of our knowledge 3D deep learning network based on a dual generative adversarial network dual-GAN framework for recovering high-resolution HR volume images from high speed acquired low-resolution LR volume images. The proposed method does not require a precise image registration process and meanwhile guarantees the predicted HR volume image faithful to its corresponding LR volume image. The results demonstrated that our method can recover ${20} {\\times} /1.0\\text-{\\rm NA}$20/1.0-NA volume images from coarsely registered ${5} {\\times} /0.16\\text-{\\rm NA}$5/0.16-NA volume images collected by light-sheet microscopy. This method would provide great potential in applications which require high resolution volume imaging. 3D high resolution generative deep-learning network for fluorescence microscopy imaging.
