Inertial sensors are one of the most commonly used sources of data for human activity recognition HAR and exercise detection ED tasks. The time series produced by these sensors are generally analyzed through numerical methods. Machine learning techniques such as random forests or support vector machines are popular in this field for classification efforts but they need to be supported through the isolation of a potentially large number of additionally crafted features derived from the raw data. This feature preprocessing step can involve nontrivial digital signal processing DSP techniques. However in many cases the researchers interested in this type of activity recognition problems do not possess the necessary technical background for this feature-set development.
