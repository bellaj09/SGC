Patient-specific quality assurance QA measurement is conducted to confirm the accuracy of dose delivery. However measurement is time-consuming and places a heavy workload on the medical physicists and radiological technologists. In this study we proposed a prediction model for gamma evaluation based on deep learning. We applied the model to a QA measurement dataset of prostate cancer cases to evaluate its practicality. A deep learning-based prediction model for gamma evaluation in patient-specific quality assurance.
