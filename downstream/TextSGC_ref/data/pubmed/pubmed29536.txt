Cognitive rehabilitation is established as a core intervention within rehabilitation programs following a traumatic brain injury TBI. Digitally enabled assistive technologies offer opportunities for clinicians to increase remote access to rehabilitation supporting transition into home. Brain Computer Interface BCI systems can harness the residual abilities of individuals with limited function to gain control over computers through their brain waves. This paper presents an online cognitive rehabilitation application developed with therapists to work remotely with people who have TBI who will use BCI at home to engage in the therapy. A qualitative research study was completed with people who are community dwellers post brain injury end users and a cohort of therapists involved in cognitive rehabilitation. A user-centered approach over three phases in the development design and feasibility testing of this cognitive rehabilitation application included two tasks Find-a-Category and a Memory Card task. The therapist could remotely prescribe activity with different levels of difficulty. The service user had a home interface which would present the therapy activities. This novel work was achieved by an international consortium of academics business partners and service users. A qualitative study adopting a user-centered approach to design and validate a brain computer interface for cognitive rehabilitation for people with brain injury.
