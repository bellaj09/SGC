This study focuses on the identification of Motor Imagery MI tasks for the development of Brain Computer Interface BCI technologies combining Cross-Correlation and Logistic Regression CC-LR techniques. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark data sets IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III and the performance is evaluated through a 3-fold cross-validation procedure. The experimental outcomes are compared with two recently reported algorithms R-Common Spatial Pattern CSP with aggregation and Clustering Technique CT-based Least Square Support Vector Machine LS-SVM and also other four algorithms using data set IVa. The results demonstrate that our proposed method results in an improvement of at least 3.47% compared with the existing methods tested.
