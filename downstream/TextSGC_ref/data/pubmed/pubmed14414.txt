Diabetic retinopathy DR is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. However 90% of DR caused blindness can be prevented if diagnosed and intervened early. Retinal exudates can be observed at the early stage of DR and can be used as signs for early DR diagnosis. Deep convolutional neural networks DCNNs have been applied for exudate detection with promising results. However there exist two main challenges when applying the DCNN based methods for exudate detection. One is the very limited number of labeled data available from medical experts and another is the severely imbalanced distribution of data of different classes. First there are many more images of normal eyes than those of eyes with exudates particularly for screening datasets. Second the number of normal pixels non-exudates is much greater than the number of abnormal pixels exudates in images containing exudates. To tackle the small sample set problem an ensemble convolutional neural network MU-net based on a U-net structure is presented in this paper. To alleviate the imbalance data problem the conditional generative adversarial network cGAN is adopted to generate label-preserving minority class data specifically to implement the data augmentation. The network was trained on one dataset e_ophtha_EX and tested on the other three public datasets DiaReTDB1 HEI-MED and MESSIDOR. CGAN as a data augmentation method significantly improves network robustness and generalization properties achieving F1-scores of 92.79% 92.46% 91.27% and 94.34% respectively as measured at the lesion level. While without cGAN the corresponding F1-scores were 92.66% 91.41% 90.72% and 90.58% respectively. When measured at the image level with cGAN we achieved the accuracy of 95.45% 92.13% 88.76% and 89.58% compared with the values achieved without cGAN of 86.36% 87.64% 76.33% and 86.42% respectively.
