Electrosurgery is a modality that is widely used in surgery whose use has resulted in injuries OR fires and even death. The SAGES has established the FUSE program to address the knowledge gap in the proper and safe usage of electrosurgical devices. Complementing it we have developed the Virtual Electrosurgery Skill Trainer VEST which is designed to train subjects in both cognitive and motor skills necessary to safely operate electrosurgical devices. The objective of this study is to asses the face validity of the VEST simulator. Face validation of the Virtual Electrosurgery Skill Trainer VEST.
