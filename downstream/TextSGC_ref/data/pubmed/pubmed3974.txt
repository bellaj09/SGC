cAMP signaling affects a large number of the developmental processes needed for the construction of the CNS including cell differentiation axon outgrowth response to guidance molecules or modulation of synaptic connections. This points to a key role of adenylate cyclases ACs the synthetic enzymes of cAMP for neural development. ACs exist as 10 different isoforms which are activated by distinct signaling pathways. The implication of specific AC isoforms in neural wiring was only recently demonstrated in mouse mutants knockout KO for different AC isoforms AC1 AC3 AC5 AC8 and soluble sAC/AC10. These studies stressed the importance of three of these isoforms as sensors of neural activity that could modify the survival of neurons sAC axon outgrowth sAC or the response of axons to guidance molecules such as ephrins AC1 or semaphorins AC3. We summarize here the current knowledge on the role of these ACs for the development of sensory maps in the somatosensory visual and olfactory systems which have been the most extensively studied. In these systems AC1/AC3 KO revealed targeting mistakes due to the defective pruning and lack of discrimination of incoming axons to signals present in target structures. In contrast no changes in cell differentiation survival or axon outgrowth were noted in these mutants suggesting a specificity of cAMP production routes for individual cellular processes within a given neuron. Further studies indicate that the subcellular localization of ACs could be key to their specific role in axon targeting and may explain their selective roles in neuronal wiring.
