"Locked-in syndrome LIS is characterized by an inability to move or speak in the presence of intact cognition and can be caused by brainstem trauma or neuromuscular disease. Quality of life QoL in LIS is strongly impaired by the inability to communicate which cannot always be remedied by traditional augmentative and alternative communication AAC solutions if residual muscle activity is insufficient to control the AAC device. Brain-computer interfaces BCIs may offer a solution by employing the persons neural signals instead of relying on muscle activity. Here we review the latest communication BCI research using noninvasive signal acquisition approaches electroencephalography functional magnetic resonance imaging functional near-infrared spectroscopy and subdural and intracortical implanted electrodes and we discuss current efforts to translate research knowledge into usable BCI-enabled communication solutions that aim to improve the QoL of individuals with LIS." Brain-computer interfaces for communication.
