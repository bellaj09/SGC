"Event-related potentials ERPs are one of the most popular control signals for brain-computer interfaces BCIs. However they are very weak and sensitive to the experimental settings including paradigms stimulation parameters and even surrounding environments resulting in a diversity of ERP patterns across different BCI experiments. Its still a challenge to develop a general decoding algorithm that can adapt to the ERP diversities of different BCI datasets with small training sets. This study compared a recently developed algorithm i.e. discriminative canonical pattern matching DCPM with seven ERP-BCI classification methods i.e. linear discriminant analysis LDA stepwise LDA bayesian LDA shrinkage LDA spatial-temporal discriminant analysis STDA xDAWN and EEGNet for the single-trial classification of two private EEG datasets and three public EEG datasets with small training sets. The feature ERPs of the five datasets included P300 motion visual evoked potential mVEP and miniature asymmetric visual evoked potential aVEP. Study results showed that the DCPM outperformed other classifiers for all of the tested datasets suggesting the DCPM is a robust classification algorithm for assessing a wide range of ERP components."
