Chemical-disease relation CDR extraction is significantly important to various areas of biomedical research and health care. Nowadays many large-scale biomedical knowledge bases KBs containing triples about entity pairs and their relations have been built. KBs are important resources for biomedical relation extraction. However previous research pays little attention to prior knowledge. In addition the dependency tree contains important syntactic and semantic information which helps to improve relation extraction. So how to effectively use it is also worth studying. In this paper we propose a novel convolutional attention network CAN for CDR extraction. Firstly we extract the shortest dependency path SDP between chemical and disease pairs in a sentence which includes a sequence of words dependency directions and dependency relation tags. Then the convolution operations are performed on the SDP to produce deep semantic dependency features. After that an attention mechanism is employed to learn the importance/weight of each semantic dependency vector related to knowledge representations learned from KBs. Finally in order to combine dependency information and prior knowledge the concatenation of weighted semantic dependency representations and knowledge representations is fed to the softmax layer for classification. Experiments on the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art systems and both dependency information and prior knowledge play important roles in CDR extraction task.
