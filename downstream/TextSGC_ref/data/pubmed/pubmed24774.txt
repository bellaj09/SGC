The majority of near-infrared spectroscopy NIRS brain-computer interface BCI studies have investigated binary classification problems. Limited work has considered differentiation of more than two mental states or multi-class differentiation of higher-level cognitive tasks using measurements outside of the anterior prefrontal cortex. Improvements in accuracies are needed to deliver effective communication with a multi-class NIRS system. We investigated the feasibility of a ternary NIRS-BCI that supports mental states corresponding to verbal fluency task VFT performance Stroop task performance and unconstrained rest using prefrontal and parietal measurements. Towards a ternary NIRS-BCI: single-trial classification of verbal fluency task Stroop task and unconstrained rest.
