The ability to accurately and efficiently compute quantum-mechanical partial atomistic charges has many practical applications such as calculations of IR spectra analysis of chemical bonding and classical force field parametrization. Machine learning ML techniques provide a possible avenue for the efficient prediction of atomic partial charges. Modern ML advances in the prediction of molecular energies i.e. the hierarchical interacting particle neural network HIP-NN has provided the necessary model framework and architecture to predict transferable extensible and conformationally dynamic atomic partial charges based on reference density functional theory DFT simulations. Utilizing HIP-NN we show that ML charge prediction can be highly accurate over a wide range of molecules both small and large across a variety of charge partitioning schemes such as the Hirshfeld CM5 MSK and NBO methods. To demonstrate transferability and size extensibility we compare ML results with reference DFT calculations on the COMP6 benchmark achieving errors of 0.004e- elementary charge. This is remarkable since this benchmark contains two proteins that are multiple times larger than the largest molecules in the training set. An application of our atomic charge predictions on nonequilibrium geometries is the generation of IR spectra for organic molecules from dynamical trajectories on a variety of organic molecules which show good agreement with calculated IR spectra with reference method. Critically HIP-NN charge predictions are many orders of magnitude faster than direct DFT calculations. These combined results provide further evidence that ML specifically HIP-NN provides a pathway to greatly increase the range of feasible simulations while retaining quantum-level accuracy.
