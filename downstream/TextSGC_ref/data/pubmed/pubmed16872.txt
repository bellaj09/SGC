Monitoring breath and identifying breathing movements have settled importance in many biomedical research areas especially in the treatment of those with breathing disorders e.g. lung cancer patients. Moreover virtual reality VR revolution and their implementations on ubiquitous hand-held devices have a lot of implications which could be used as a simulation technology for healing purposes. In this paper a novel method is proposed to detect and classify breathing movements. The overall VR framework is intended to encourage the subjects regulate their breath by classifying the breathing movements in real time. This paper focuses on a portion of the overall VR framework that deals with classifying the acoustic signal of respiration movements. We employ Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients MFCCs along with speech segmentation techniques using voice activity detection and linear thresholding to the acoustic signal of breath captured using a microphone to depict the differences between inhale and exhale in frequency domain. For every subject 13 MFCCs of all voiced segments are computed and plotted. The inhale and exhale phases are differentiated using the sixth MFCC order which carries important classification information. Experimental results on a number of individuals verify our proposed classification methodology. Acoustic signal classification of breathing movements to virtually aid breath regulation.
