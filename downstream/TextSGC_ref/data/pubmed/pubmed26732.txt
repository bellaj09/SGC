Brain-machine interfaces BMI may support motor impaired patients during activities of daily living by controlling external devices such as prostheses assistive BMI. Moreover BMIs are applied in conjunction with robotic orthoses for rehabilitation of lost motor function via neurofeedback training restorative BMI. Using assistive BMI in a rehabilitation context does not automatically turn them into restorative devices. This perspective article suggests key features of restorative BMI and provides the supporting evidence: In summary BMI may be referred to as restorative tools when demonstrating subsequently i operant learning and progressive evolution of specific brain states/dynamics ii correlated modulations of functional networks related to the therapeutic goal iii subsequent improvement in a specific task and iv an explicit correlation between the modulated brain dynamics and the achieved behavioral gains. Such findings would provide the rationale for translating BMI-based interventions into clinical settings for reinforcement learning and motor rehabilitation following stroke.
