Predicting RNA-binding protein RBP specificity is important for understanding gene expression regulation and RNA-mediated enzymatic processes. It is widely believed that RBP binding specificity is determined by both the sequence and structural contexts of RNAs. Existing approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and more recently deep learning models have been extensively applied to integrate RNA sequence and its predicted or experimental RNA structural probabilities for improving the accuracy of RBP binding prediction. Such models were trained mostly on the large-scale in vitro datasets such as the RNAcompete dataset. However in RNAcompete most synthetic RNAs are unstructured which makes machine learning methods not effectively extract RBP-binding structural preferences. Furthermore RNA structure may be variable or multi-modal according to both theoretical and experimental evidence. In this work we propose ThermoNet a thermodynamic prediction model by integrating a new sequence-embedding convolutional neural network model over a thermodynamic ensemble of RNA secondary structures. First the sequence-embedding convolutional neural network generalizes the existing k-mer based methods by jointly learning convolutional filters and k-mer embeddings to represent RNA sequence contexts. Second the thermodynamic average of deep-learning predictions is able to explore structural variability and improves the prediction especially for the structured RNAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches including RCK DeepBind and several other recent state-of-the-art methods for predictions on both in vitro and in vivo data. The implementation of ThermoNet is available at https://github.com/suyufeng/ThermoNet. Integrating thermodynamic and sequence contexts improves protein-RNA binding prediction.
