"A brain-machine interface BMI records neural signals in real time from a subjects brain interprets them as motor commands and reroutes them to a device such as a robotic arm so as to restore lost motor function. Our objective here is to improve BMI performance by minimizing the deleterious effects of delay in the BMI control loop. We mitigate the effects of delay by decoding the subjects intended movements a short time lead in the future." Improving brain-machine interface performance by decoding intended future movements.
