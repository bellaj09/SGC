Given the current pandemic situation of COVID-19, the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES) issued the recommendation for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy based on the status of COVID-19 as of April 9th, 2020, in Japan; 1) indications for GI endoscopy in the pandemic of COVID-19, 2) practical protective equipment for medical personals depending on the risk for COVID-19, 3) preprocedural management, such as pharyngeal local anesthesia using lidocaine spray which has a potential to generate the aerosols, 4) ideal settings of the endoscopy room including the numbers of the staff and the patients, 5) postprocedural management, such as undressing and follow-up of the patients, as well as the involved staff, were documented to fit the practical scenarios in GI endoscopy, with the available data in Japan and the world.
