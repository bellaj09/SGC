working in the dark: interaction with a sub clinical covid-19 subject and lessons learned. ¬© 2020 Elsevier LtdSubclinical COVID-19 subjects pose a significant challenge. We present a very close clinical interaction with a subclinical COVID-19 subject that met the ‚Äústandard screening criteria‚Äù and is unique in several ways. Learning from our experience, we suggest close attention should be paid to any unexpected findings such as groundglass opacity on CT as it could help early identification of subclinical COVID-19 infection.
