proinflammatory cytokines in the olfactory mucosa result in covid-19 induced anosmia. ¬© 2020 American Chemical Society.Studies have found increased rates of dysosmia in patients with Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the mechanism that causes olfactory loss is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to explore local proinflammatory cytokine levels in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. Biopsies of the olfactory epithelium were taken from patients with confirmed COVID-19 as well as uninfected controls. Levels of tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNF-Œ±) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1Œ≤) were assessed using ELISA and compared between groups. Average TNF-Œ± levels were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, no differences in IL-1Œ≤ were seen between groups. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-Œ± were seen in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that direct inflammation of the olfactory epithelium could play a role in the acute olfactory loss described in many patients with COVID-19.
