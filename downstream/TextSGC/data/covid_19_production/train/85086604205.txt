how isg15 combats viral infection. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is a ubiquitin-like protein critical for the control of microbial infections. ISG15 appears to serve a wide variety of functions, which regulate multiple cellular responses contributing to the development of an antiviral state. ISG15 is a versatile molecule directly modulating both host and virus protein function which regulate many signaling pathways, including its own synthesis. Here we review the various roles ISG15 plays in the antiviral immune response, and examine the mechanisms by which viruses attempt to mitigate or exploit ISG15 activity.
