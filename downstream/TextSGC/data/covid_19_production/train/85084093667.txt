consideration of dornase alfa for the treatment of severe covid-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome. ¬© 2020 The Author(s)We propose a likely contribution to severe COVID-19 morbidity by extracellular DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Dornase alfa degrades extracellular DNA to reduce mucus rigidity and accumulation, and was associated with respiratory improvement in a first patient. Dornase alfa should be considered for clinical trials in treatment of severe COVID-19.
