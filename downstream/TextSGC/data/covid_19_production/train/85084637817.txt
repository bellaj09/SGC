repurposing antivirals as potential treatments for sars-cov-2: from sars to covid-19. ¬© 2020 David Gomez-Rios et al.The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent of the current pandemic of the respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The government and health authorities around the world have advocated social distancing, containment measures, and effective diagnosis as the first measures to slow down the spread of the disease, but, still, treatment options are urgent, especially for patients evolving to severe pneumonia. Several pharmaceuticals with antiviral effects were identified and tested, to some extent, during the previous SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks. Type I interferons (IFNs), ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir emerge as the primary options for in-hospital treatment of patients with COVID-19, focused on reducing the viral load. Although more experimental and clinical evidence is required, the accumulated in vitro and clinical knowledge discussed here supports those drugs as feasible alternatives to face the SARS-CoV infection in the short term, whereas more effective measures arise from the world scientific community.
