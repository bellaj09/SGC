All rights reserved.Liver injury has been reported to occur during the disease in severe cases. Therefore, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the incidence of liver injury among published literature from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03 to provide an outline for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19. Four databases including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Scopus Were searched for studies published from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03. Data analysis and drawing of charts Were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 2.2 (Biostat, USA). The search yielded 450 publications, of Which 64 potentially eligible studies Were identified for full-text Review and 21 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria remained. A total of 4191 COVID-19 patients Were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of liver injury Was 19.5% (95% CI: 14.3-26.1). According to our results, there Was significant heterogeneity among the 19 studies (X2=738.5; p<0.001; I2 =94.34%). Among 288 death cases, the pooled prevalence of liver injury Was 22.8% (95% CI: 11.7-39.8). In summary, the COVID-19 disease itself can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases and even may lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. The results of this systematic Review highlight the importance of liver injury that may assist clinicians anywhere in the globe in controlling COVID-19-related infection and complications. Moreover, the prevalence of liver injury can be higher in severe cases than in mild cases.
