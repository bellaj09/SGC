coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pneumonia incidentally detected on coronary ct angiogram: a do-not-miss diagnosis. ¬© 2020, American Society of Emergency Radiology.Coronary CT angiograms are commonly performed for the evaluation of coronary artery disease and coronary arterial anatomy. However, extracardiac findings are frequently detected on these examinations and often can explain patients‚Äô underlying symptoms, having a significant impact on patient management. Here in, we discuss three cases of incidentally detected novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP). This case series highlights the image findings in NCIP and emphasizes the importance of evaluating all organs in the field of view on coronary CT angiograms. In addition, with the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, this report stresses the need for including NCIP in the differential diagnosis of patients with typical image findings in at-risk populations, as early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate patient management and post-exposure recommendations.
