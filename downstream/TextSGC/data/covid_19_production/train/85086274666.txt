taste and smell impairment in covid-19: an aao-hns anosmia reporting tool-based comparative study. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.Objective: To identify the taste and smell impairment in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)‚Äìpositive subjects and compare the findings with COVID-19‚Äìnegative subjects using the American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Anosmia Reporting Tool. Setting: Tertiary referral center/COVID-19 pandemic hospital. Study Design: Comparative study. Subjects and Methods: After power analysis, 128 subjects were divided into 2 groups according to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 testing results. Subjects were called via telephone, and the AAO-HNS Anosmia Reporting Tool was used to collect responses. Results: The mean age of the study group was 38.63 ¬± 10.08 years. At the time of sampling, rhinorrhea was significantly high in the COVID-19‚Äìnegative group, whereas those complaints described as ‚Äúother‚Äù were significantly high in the COVID-19‚Äìpositive group. There was a significant difference in the smell/taste impairment rates of the groups (n = 46% [71.9%] for the COVID-19‚Äìpositive group vs n = 17 [26.6%] for the COVID-19‚Äìnegative group, P =.001). For subjects with a smell impairment, anosmia rates did not differ between the groups. The rates of hyposmia and parosmia were significantly high in the COVID-19‚Äìpositive group. For the subjects with taste impairment, ageusia rates did not differ between groups. The rate of hypogeusia and dysgeusia was significantly high in the COVID-19‚Äìpositive group. Logistic regression analysis indicates that smell/taste impairment in COVID-19‚Äìpositive subjects increases the odds ratio by 6.956 (95% CI, 3.16-15.29) times. Conclusion: COVID-19‚Äìpositive subjects are strongly associated with smell/taste impairment.
