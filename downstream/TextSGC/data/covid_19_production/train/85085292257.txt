This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to international concern. We aimed to establish an effective screening strategy in Shanghai, China, to aid early identification of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We did a multicentre, observational cohort study in fever clinics of 25 hospitals in 16 districts of Shanghai. All patients visiting the clinics within the study period were included. A strategy for COVID-19 screening was presented and then suspected cases were monitored and analysed until they were confirmed as cases or excluded. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of COVID-19. Findings: We enrolled patients visiting fever clinics from Jan 17 to Feb 16, 2020. Among 53 617 patients visiting fever clinics, 1004 (1¬∑9%) were considered as suspected cases, with 188 (0¬∑4% of all patients, 18¬∑7% of suspected cases) eventually diagnosed as confirmed cases. 154 patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Exposure history (odds ratio [OR] 4¬∑16, 95% CI 2¬∑74‚Äì6¬∑33; p<0¬∑0001), fatigue (OR 1¬∑56, 1¬∑01‚Äì2¬∑41; p=0¬∑043), white blood cell count less than 4 √ó 109 per L (OR 2¬∑44, 1¬∑28‚Äì4¬∑64; p=0¬∑0066), lymphocyte count less than 0¬∑8 √ó 109 per L (OR 1¬∑82, 1¬∑00‚Äì3¬∑31; p=0¬∑049), ground glass opacity (OR 1¬∑95, 1¬∑32‚Äì2¬∑89; p=0¬∑0009), and having both lungs affected (OR 1¬∑54, 1¬∑04‚Äì2¬∑28; p=0¬∑032) were independent risk factors for confirmed COVID-19. Interpretation: The screening strategy was effective for confirming or excluding COVID-19 during the spread of this contagious disease. Relevant independent risk factors identified in this study might be helpful for early recognition of the disease. Funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China.
