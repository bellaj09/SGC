five-early" model: the magic weapon against covid-19. ¬© 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health. All rights reserved.Background: COVID-19(2019 novel coronavirus disease)has brought tremendous pressure to the prevention and control of the national epidemic due to its concealed onset, strong infectivity and fast transmission speed. Methods: In this retrospective study, 226 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in the Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital were included. The patients' clinical data, including general information, initial symptoms at the onset, time of disease diagnosis, time to treatment in hospital, time of nucleic acid conversion to negative, disease classification, total time of hospitalization were collected. The clinical data of the mild and severe patients were compared. Results: Fever, cough, sore throat, poor appetite andfatigue were the main symptoms of the diagnosed patients. The time of diagnosis was significantly shorter in the mild patients (4.96 ¬± 4.10 days) than severe patients (7.63 ¬± 9.17 days) (P=0.004). Mild patients had shorter time to treatment in hospital (6.09 ¬± 4.47 vs. 8.71 ¬± 9.04 days) and less time of nucleic acid conversion to negative (7.58 ¬± 2.51 vs. 11.6 ¬± 4.67 days) compared to the severe patients. Conclusion: The above results can be used as a quantitative basis for the ‚Äúfive-early"(early detection, early screening, early diagnosis, early isolation treatment, and early recovery) model. The government, the masses, and the hospitals' joint prevention and optimization of the "five-early" model will provide important scientific reference for further prevention and control of the epidemics.
