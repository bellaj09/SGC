The aim of this study Was to report the radiological features of chest CT scan of patients With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) living in a town in Southern Italy Where a significant outbreak of the disease occurred. Methods. We revised the CT scan of 62 patients (34 male, 28 female, mean age 71+/-14 years) With clinical and laboratory signs of COVID-19, as assessed by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. All patients underwent chest CT at the time of admission to the hospital. A semi-quantitative scoring system Was used to evaluate the extension of the disease. Results. Out of the 62 patients the main radiological findings Were reticular pattern (29%), ground-glass opacities (24%), crazy paving pattern (11%) and consolidation (35%). Most of the lesions Were bilateral (97%), posterior (95%) and located near pleura (50%) or lung fissures (45%), mainly involving the lower right lobe (56%) and lower left lobe (23%). Pleural thickening Was observed in 72.6% of patients and pleural effusion in 18%. Median value of the score Was 7.0 and Was significantly higher in male than female (8.5 vs 6.0, p=0.03) and in patients With pleural thickening compared to those Without this finding (8.0 vs 5.0, p=0.03) Conclusions. We have observed patients With different stages of the disease. Lung score Was significantly higher in male than female confirming the clinical observation of a Worst prognosis in male subjects. Pleural thickening Was frequently observed and significantly associated With a higher lung score suggesting a possible association With a more severe disease.
