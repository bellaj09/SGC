Methods: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (‚Äúvery low,‚Äù ‚Äúlow,‚Äù ‚Äúmoderate,‚Äù ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù and ‚Äúvery high‚Äù) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. Results: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8th to February 28th, 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: ‚Äúlow‚Äù (first), ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù (second), ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (third), ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (fourth), ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (fifth), ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (sixth), ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (seventh), and ‚Äúvery high‚Äù (eighth). Conclusion: The KCDC's 8 risk assessments were utilized to activate national emergency response mechanisms and eventually prepare for the pandemic to ensure the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.
