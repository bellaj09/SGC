on the distinction between fear and anxiety in a (post)pandemic world: a commentary on schimmenti et al. (2020. ¬© Clinical Neuropsychiatry.Taking stock of the global mental health challenges created by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Schimmenti, Billieux, and Starcevic (2020) recently provided, in this journal, a radically new theoretical framework for conceptualizing the experience of fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, I reflect on the implications of Schimmenti and colleagues‚Äô sole focus on fear, without taking into account the notion of anxiety. I argue that the conceptual and functional distinction between fear and anxiety may further strengthen the theoretical foundations of Schimmenti and colleagues‚Äô model. Finally, I discuss how such a distinction can ultimately help at better identifying new clinical targets not only for psychological interventions but also for policy recommendations.
