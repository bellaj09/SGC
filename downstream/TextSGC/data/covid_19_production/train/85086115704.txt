obesity and covid-19 outcomes: a risk factor that needs attention. ¬© 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.Obesity, a comorbidity not well documented in the COVID-19 pandemic, is now being identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection, including in those less than 60 years of age. We discuss parallels of increased severity, prolonged viral shedding of influenza A (H1N1) which are relevant, and the mechanisms which link obesity to inflammation and severity of infections. We suggest that weights and heights be recorded in all case-record forms and epidemiologic surveillance tools to assess the associations of body mass index with infection status and disease outcomes. Obese individuals should be closely monitored in view of the risk of increased severity of COVID-19 infection.
