hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: a disease not to be forgotten during the covid-19 pandemic. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.From November 2019 to date, almost six thousand papers have been published on COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. As physicians working in a multidisciplinary centre for the cure of Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) in a country (Italy) that has been severely affected by COVID-19, we are surprised that, among this impressive amount of publications, there is none on HHT. Indeed, we performed our last PubMed search on 22 April 2020, using the keywords ‚ÄúHereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia‚Äù OR ‚ÄúHereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia‚Äù OR ‚ÄúHHT‚Äù OR ‚ÄúRendu-Osler-Weber‚Äù AND ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù OR ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù, and found no papers. This is surprising, because, although HHT is a rare disease, there are many reasons why we believe that it deserves special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.
