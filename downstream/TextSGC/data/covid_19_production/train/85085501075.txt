covid-19 pandemic and cardiovascular disease. ¬© 2020 All rights reserved.There seems to be a unique interplay between 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and cardiovascular diseases, although it is predominantly a respiratory illness. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular co-morbidities appear to be at highest risk for mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) along with the elderly; COVID-19 also contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, myocarditis, acute heart failure, and, in the most severe cases, cardiogenic shock and death. Several medications proposed in the treatment of COVID-19 require cardiac monitoring owing to their cardiac-specific adverse effects. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized the safety of heart transplantation and has placed transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapies at significant risk. In this article, the authors summarize the rapidly emerging data on the cardiovascular implications of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
