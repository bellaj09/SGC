Most residential and commercial buildings utilize MERV-5 to MERV-11, and in critical health care settings, MERV-12 or higher and HEPA filters are used. MERV-13 filters have the potential to remove microbes and other particles ranging from 0.3 to 10.0 Œºm. Most viruses, including CoVs, range from 0.004 to 1.0 Œºm, limiting the effectiveness of these filtration techniques against pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 (52). Furthermore, no filter system is perfect. Recently,.... was changed to HEPA filters are rated to remove at least 99.97% of particles at 0.3 Œºm in size, representing the most penetrating particle size (51). Most residential and commercial buildings utilize MERV-5 to MERV-11, and in critical health care settings, MERV-13 or higher and HEPA filters are used. MERV-13 filters have the potential to remove microbes and other particles ranging from 0.3 to 10.0 Œºm. Most viruses, including CoVs, range from 0.004 to 1.0 Œºm (52). However, viruses are rarely observed as individual particles, but instead are expelled from the body already combined with water, proteins, salts, and other components as large droplets and aerosols. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in aerosolized particles in a spectrum of sizes including 0.25 to 0.5 Œºm (96), necessitating high efficiency filtration techniques to reduce the transmission potential of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. However,....

Even though some of these particles have been identified in sizes that could potentially penetrate high efficiency filters, ventilation and filtration remain important in reducing the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2.
