information overload: a method to share updates among frontline staff during the covid-19 pandemic. ¬© American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.Since COVID-19 was classified as a pandemic, the stream of important information from multiple sources is constant and always changing. As the pandemic evolves, the need to report relevant information to frontline providers remains crucial. A 1-page centralized document termed a ‚Äúquicksheet‚Äù was developed to include guidelines, policies, and practical information and to serve as a reference tool for our clinicians. It was updated and distributed frequently, up to once daily. It was initially embraced as an important resource for resident physicians and then quickly adopted by the entire department as a necessary reference and communication tool during the ongoing crisis. The quicksheet has been a beneficial tool to distill and organize the most important and relevant information for frontline staff, and we hope that it can serve as a template for departments and health care workers in other hospital systems to adopt.
