the innate immune system: fighting on the front lines or fanning the flames of covid-19. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had devastating global impacts and will continue to have dramatic effects on public health for years to come. A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the application and development of therapeutics. The degree to which the innate immune response confers protection or induces pathogenesis through a dysregulated immune response remains unclear. In this review, we discuss what is known about the role of the innate immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest directions for future studies, and evaluate proposed COVID-19 immunomodulating therapeutics.¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.In this Minireview, Julia McKechnie and Catherine Blish discuss recent studies on the role of the innate immune response during SARS-Cov2 infection. They provide insights into the potential of immunomodulatory drugs as therapies and identify gaps for furthering our understanding of COVID-19.
