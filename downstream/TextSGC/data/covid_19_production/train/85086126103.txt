Results: The CVR of 46 questions was equal to 1, making them acceptably valid (CVR > 0.78), so that the items could be arranged into a final questionnaire. Moreover, all items could successfully attain CVI values above 0.79, confirming the content validity of the questionnaire. The Cronbach‚Äôs alpha was between 0.80‚Äì0.95 for different sections of questionaire, confirming the stable reliability and high repeatability of the questionnaire.
