vitamin-d: an immune shield against ncovid-19. ¬© 2020, Radiance Research Academy. All rights reserved.Presently the world is battling a deadly pandemic without any effective licenced drugs or biologics to vanquish SARS-CoV-2. The experience of managing the past viral aetiological outbreaks has been extrapolated to nCOVID-19, yet its effectiveness is uncertain. This connotation invokes a potential insight to focus upon those elements and etiquettes which are an integral part of our life and expound for nCOVID-19 treatment. This further impels us to consider our food as a time-tested medicine. In a study, a decrease in Vitamin-D levels accounted for the bovine coronavirus infection in calves. Interestingly it paves the way for exploring the role of Vitamin-D as an accessible ‚Äòmagic bullet‚Äô against nCOVID-19. Currently, its metabolism and immunomodulatory characterization are well-established. In fact, the studies have described an inverse relationship between Vitamin-D level and respiratory infections. This further substantiates for understanding its shielding effect against nCOVID-19. Few researchers have recommended dosage of Vitamin-D intake among adult and high-risk individuals including front-liners. However, the enforcement of this potent nutritional ergogenic calls for dose rationalisation with due effectivity and safety based on large randomized controlled trials.
