accommodation employment growth and volatility: welcome aboard for a rocky ride. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.This applied tourism research note considers employment growth and volatility in the hospitality industry, using hospitality, that is, lodging, as surrogate for the broader tourism economy. The research, with data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, is relevant to communities concerned with balancing the economic opportunities presented by tourism development with the employment impacts of the industry. Findings suggest that employment trends in the industry are far from stable. Based on US data over a recent 5-year period, it was determined that hospitality employment was significantly more volatile than was the national economy. The industry‚Äôs growth, however, significantly outpaced the broad economy. The research considers the implication of these findings, adding to the tourism economics academic literature while providing important insight for communities as they consider tourism as part of their future development plans.
