the rationale for low-molecular weight heparin (lmwh) use in sars-cov-2 infection. ¬© 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche. All rights reserved.In spite of many ongoing attempts to repurpose existing antivirals, no drugs have emerged yet With the desirable activity against SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, umifenovir, favipiravir, ribavirin and b-interferon-1 gave rise to variable but still inconsistent proof of clinical efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Pathogenetic studies have shown significant differences between commonly defined viral pneumonia and COVID-19 pulmonary disease. In severe forms, immune/inflammatory alterations reminiscent of disease forms like Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have been described, and therapeutic options other than anti-infective have been proposed and implemented, such as anti-inflammatory and anticoagulative agents. The thrombotic phenomena described in the pulmonary vascular bed of patients With severe COVID-19 suggest the administration of low-molecular Weight heparin (LMwH) as standard measure in hospitalized patients With COVID-19.
