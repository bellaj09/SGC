q-bot, the quarantine robot: joint-media engagement between children and adults about quarantine living experiences. ¬© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Information about the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine can be challenging to communicate to children. The purpose of this study is to understand how a children‚Äôs eBook can help facilitate conversations between children, families and educators about the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A children‚Äôs eBook Q-Bot: The Quarantine Robot was shared by the researcher with parents and teachers through social media (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter). The story provides information (based on CDC guidelines) on the best health and hygiene practices to avoid catching the virus, while also drawing attention to the hardworking people who are helping us through this experience. Data was collected as public comments on the eBook. Secondary data included other children‚Äôs eBooks available on the same theme and their public reviews. Findings: Through open coding of comments, the researcher found that the children‚Äôs eBook helped in facilitation of discussion between children, parents and teachers; around the pandemic‚Äôs effects on health and hygiene practices; and remote learning experiences. A content analysis of other children‚Äôs books on this theme revealed a set of guidelines for designing helpful eBooks for pandemic quarantine situations in general. Research limitations/implications: Education, media and health researchers may find this study helpful in understanding the potential of children‚Äôs eBooks as probes, prompts or communication tools. Practical implications: Experts in pandemic-related issues, educators, illustrators and authors may find this study helpful in understanding guidelines for creating educational children‚Äôs eBooks for similar situations in the future. Originality/value: Both theoretical and practical values are addressed through this study, as it provides helpful literature from past research, offers new insights from current study and guidelines for future work in narrative media design for the pandemic and other similar situations.
