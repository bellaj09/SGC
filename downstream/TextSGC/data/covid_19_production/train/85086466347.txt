evaluation of remote monitoring device for monitoring vital parameters against reference standard: a diagnostic validation study for covid-19 preparedness. ¬© 2020 Indian Journal of Community Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.Context: Vital parameters including blood oxygen level, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature are crucial for triaging patients to appropriate medical care. Advances in remote health monitoring system and wearable health devices have created a new horizon for delivery of efficient health care from a distance. Materials and Methods: This diagnostic validation study included patients attending the outpatient department of the institute. The accuracy of device under study was compared against the gold standard patient monitoring systems used in intensive care units. Statistical Analysis: The statistical analysis involved computation of intraclass correlation coefficient. Bland-Altman graphs with limits of agreement were plotted to assess agreement between methods. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 200 patients, including 152 males and 48 females in the age range of 2-80 years, formed the study group. A strong correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient; r > 0.9) was noted between the two devices for all the investigated parameters with significant P value (<0.01). Bland-Altman plot drawn for each vital parameter revealed observations in agreement from both the devices. Conclusion: The wearable device can be reliably used for remote health monitoring. Its regulated use can help mitigate the scarcity of hospital beds and reduce exposure to health-care workers and demand of personal protection equipment.
