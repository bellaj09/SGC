pandemic preparedness: developing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies for covid-19. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that causes COVID-19 respiratory syndrome has caused global public health and economic crises, necessitating rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic countermeasures. The world-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented with government, academic, and private partnerships working together to rapidly develop vaccine and antibody countermeasures. Many of the technologies being used are derived from prior government-academic partnerships for response to other emerging infections. Collaboration between academic, government, and private institutions can enable the development and sustenance of a pandemic preparedness platform that can be readily deployed upon need, as is the case with the COVID-19 pandemic.
