impact of population movement on the spread of 2019-ncov in china. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group, on behalf of Shanghai Shangyixun Cultural Communication Co., Ltd.Since Dec 2019, China has experienced an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV. A travel ban was implemented for Wuhan, Hubei on Jan 23 to slow down the outbreak. We found a significant positive correlation between population influx from Wuhan and confirmed cases in other cities across China (R2 = 0.85, P < 0.001), especially cities in Hubei (R2 = 0.88, P < 0.001). Removing the travel restriction would have increased 118% (91%‚Äì172%) of the overall cases for the coming week, and a travel ban taken three days or a week earlier would have reduced 47% (26%‚Äì58%) and 83% (78%‚Äì89%) of the early cases. We would expect a 61% (48%‚Äì92%) increase of overall cumulative cases without any restrictions on returning residents, and 11% (8%‚Äì16%) increase if the travel ban stays in place for Hubei. Cities from Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Capital Economic Circle regions are at higher risk.
