syncope, brugada syndrome, and covid-19 lung disease. ¬© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Arrhythmia published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of the Japanese Heart Rhythm Society.A 52-year-old male with no history of familiar sudden death arrived at our Emergency Department after syncope with loss of consciousness occurred during high fever. The thoracic high-resolution computed tomography demonstrated bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities. The nose-pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The 12-lead ECG presented a ‚Äúcoved-type‚Äù aspect in leads V1 and V2 at the fourth intercostal space and a first degree atrio-ventricular block. As soon as the temperature went down, the 12-lead ECG resumed a normal aspect, maintaining a long PR interval.
