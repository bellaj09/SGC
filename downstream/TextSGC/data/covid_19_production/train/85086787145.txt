commercial exchanges instead of air pollution as possible origin of covid-19 initial diffusion phase in italy: more efforts are necessary to address interdisciplinary research. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.This communication aims to advocate a more coordinate activity mainly between medical and environmental scientists to clarify some confusing information related to airborne diffusion mechanisms of COVID-19. In this frame it is suggested that parameters other than environmental pollution (accounting for pollution-to-human transmission mechanisms), as for example parameters involving commercial exchanges (accounting for human-to-human transmission mechanisms), should be considered to better justify the difference in the initial diffusion of virus in Italy.
