mental health and the covid-19 pandemic in chile. ¬© 2020 American Psychological Association.With one of the highest testing rates of COVID-19 in Latin America, Chile continues to record low mortality rates from the disease. Several measures such as curfews, cancellation of large gatherings, and closure of schools and businesses have been implemented. Against the backdrop of high levels of alcohol/substance abuse, mental health disorders, and inequalities across Chile, it is likely that levels of stress and anxiety will peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. As key public health responses such as testing, contact tracing, isolation and management of confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being ramped up, it is expedient to prioritize measures to safeguard the mental health of Chileans.
