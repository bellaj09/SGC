validity of the use of wrist and forehead temperatures in screening the general population for covid-19: a prospective real-world study. ¬© 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health. All rights reserved.Background: We aimed to compare the accuracy of individuals‚Äô wrist and forehead temperatures with their tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population in Ningbo First Hospital in China. We consecutively recorded individuals‚Äô wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (¬∞C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured individuals‚Äô tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometer (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature of ‚â•37.3 ¬∞C. Results: We enrolled 528 participants, including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We grouped the outdoor participants into four groups according to their means of transportation to the hospital: by foot, by bicycle/electric vehicle, by car, or as a passenger in a car. Under different circumstances, the mean difference in the forehead measurement ranged from-1.72 to-0.56 ¬∞C across groups, and that in the wrist measurement ranged from-0.96 to-0.61¬∞C. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in indoor patients. (Wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P<0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of the wrist measurement for detecting a tympanic temperature of ‚â•37.3 ¬∞C was 36.2 ¬∞C, with 86.4% sensitivity and 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold for the forehead measurement was 36.2 ¬∞C, with 93.2% sensitivity and 60.0% specificity. Conclusion: Wrist measurements are more stable than forehead measurements under different circumstances. Both measurements have favorable fever screening abilities in indoor patients. The cut-off values were both 36.2 ¬∞C.
