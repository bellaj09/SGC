We evaluated the performance of a molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on a high-throughput platform, the cobas 6800, using the 'open channel' for integration of a laboratory-developed assay. We observed good analytical performance in clinical specimens. The fully automated workflow enables highthroughput testing with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast and reliable results.
