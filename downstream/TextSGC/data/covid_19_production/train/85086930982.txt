We aimed to investigate the correlation between chest CT and clinical features in COVID-19 suspected patients with or without fever. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 211 COVID-19 suspected patients who underwent both chest CT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in Wuhan, China. The performance of CT in patients with relevant onset of symptoms, with fever (n = 141) and without fever (n = 70), was assessed respectively. Results: The sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 was 97.3%, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.76). There were 141 suspected patients with fever and 70 without fever. In the fever group, 4 variables were screened to establish the basic model: Age, monocyte, red blood cell, and hypertension. The AUC of the basic model was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81), while the AUC of the CT-aided model was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85), a significant difference (P <. 05). In the nonfever group, only dry cough was screened out to establish the basic model. The AUC was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64-0.88), which was not significantly different than the CT-aided model (P =. 08). Conclusions: Chest CT has a high sensitivity in patients with COVID-19, and it can improve diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 suspected patients with fever during the initial screen, whereas its value for nonfever patients remains questionable.
