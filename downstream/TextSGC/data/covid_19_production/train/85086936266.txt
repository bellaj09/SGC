the hang up. ¬© 2020 The Hastings CenterOver the past year, our ethics service has had numerous consultations involving patients who use the emergency department for regular dialysis. Sometimes, they have access to outpatient hemodialysis that they forgo; other times, they've been ‚Äúfired‚Äù from this kind of outpatient facility, and so the ED is their last option. In most of these cases, we're called because the patient is disruptive once admitted to the ICU and behavior plans haven't helped. But the call from a resident this March 2020 morning was different, the patient had end-stage renal disease and often missed hemodialysis, but he wasn't disruptive. ‚ÄúIt's just that he comes in after using cocaine, and given scarcity with the coronavirus and ICU beds‚Ä¶.‚Äù I have come to think that this is one of the more insidious effects of the pandemic: that there will be a resurgence of the view that some patients deserve health care by virtue of their compliant behavior and that those who are nonadherent don't.
