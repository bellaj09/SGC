emergency mental health legislation in response to the covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic in ireland: urgency, necessity and proportionality. ¬© 2020 Elsevier LtdMany countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of Covid-19 (coronavirus). In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur ‚Äòin person‚Äô, ‚Äòby other appropriate means‚Äô, or even, ‚Äòdue to the exigencies of the public health emergency‚Äô, not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that ‚Äòthe exigencies of the public health emergency‚Äô might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist ‚Äòno earlier than the day before‚Äô the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals ‚Äòconsisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor‚Äô. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise ‚Äònecessary in the interest of the patient‚Äô. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days ‚Äòof its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary‚Äô. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide ‚Äòa written statement‚Äô rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.
