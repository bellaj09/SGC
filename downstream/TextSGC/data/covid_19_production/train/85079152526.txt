determination of epidemiology and seasonal distribution of viral agents detected in children with respiratory tract infection solunum yolu enfeksiyonlu √ßocuklarda saptanan viral etkenlerin epidemiyolojisi ve mevsim daƒüƒ±lƒ±mƒ±nƒ±n belirlenmesi. ¬©Copyright 2019 by Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunization Society.Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the viral pathogens in the respiratory tract infections of children who applied to various outpatient clinics of our hospital and to investigate their seasonal distribution. Material and Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017, 997 children (45.1% female, 54.9% male, 0 month-17 years) who were diagnosed with upper or lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Twenty-one viral respiratory pathogens were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction method by using Fast Track FTD kit (Fast Track Diagnosis, Luxemburg). Results: One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 761 (76.3%) of 997 patients and no virus was detected in 236 (22.8%) of the patients. In our study, distrubition of respiratory tract viruses were as; Adenovirus (2.76%), Bocavirus (4.20%), Coronavirus 229E (0.92%), Coronavirus OC43 (6.96%), Enterovirus (6.04%), Metapneumovirus A (4.60%), Metapneumovirus B (4.47%), Parainfluenza 1 (0.13%), Parainfluenza 2 (1.18%), Parainfluenza 3 (8.80%), Parainfluenza 4 (1.18%), Parainfluenza 4a (0.13%), Parainfluenza 4b (0.13%), Rhinovirus (48.75%), RSVA/B (37.84%), Influenza B (3.02%) and Parechovirus (6.57%). When we observe the seasonal distribution of viral agents, RSV was the most common agent in winter and it was rhinovirus in spring, summer and autumn season. Conclusion: Approximately 80% of the patients included in the study had a viral agent that may be responsible for clinical symptoms. For this reason, the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of viruses causing viral respirato-ry infections will reduce the cost of treatment, reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics and prevent the development of resistance to antibiotics and will guide the clinician to prevent the infections caused by these viruses.
