pediatric, family-centered, ‚Äúat-home‚Äù otologic physical examination in the covid-19 era. ¬© American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus resulting in the present COVID-19 pandemic, has increased the otolaryngologist‚Äôs reliance on telemedicine to manage outpatient pathology. The nature of telemedicine, however, limits a provider‚Äôs ability to obtain a comprehensive physical examination, specifically of the tympanic membrane. Various smartphone-based otoscopic attachments are now available that facilitate patient-obtained otoscopic image capture of the tympanic membrane. Here, we present 3 cases in which a patient-purchased, over-the-counter otoscope was utilized to alter otologic management during the time of social distancing. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding the safety and efficacy of patient-based ‚Äúat-home‚Äù otoscopic examination and to optimize the use of these devices.
