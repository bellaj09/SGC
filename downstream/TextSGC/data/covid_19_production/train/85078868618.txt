Identification and removal of persistently infected animals from infected herds is a crucial component to control BVDV infection. Only limited data on serum virus concentration in infected animals are available to date. Using one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we quantified the serum viral load in 40 BVDV infected animals. To control nucleic acid extraction, complementary DNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction amplification, each serum sample was spiked with a known small amount of reference canine coronavirus. Detected ribonucleic acid copy number ranged from 2.2 √ó 106 to 7.4 √ó 108 per 1 ml of serum of persistently infected animals and from 6.6 √ó 104 to 3.3 √ó 107 of transiently infected animals. These findings support the idea that it is impossible to accurately distinguish between transiently and persistently infected animals just from a single blood sample. To use this testing as a means of declining costs of BVDV control programmes cannot be recommended and paired serum samples have to be investigated to confirm persistent infection.
