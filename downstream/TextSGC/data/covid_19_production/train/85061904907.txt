evaluation and comparison of immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of two inactivated cell culture-derived giia- and giib-genotype porcine epidemic diarrhea virus vaccines in suckling piglets. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Although highly virulent GII-genotype PEDV strains have become pandemic in the swine population worldwide, little is known about the differences in immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy between the GIIa and GIIb subgenotypes. Hence, in the present study, we vaccinated suckling piglets with GIIa (CH/HBXT/2018) and GIIb (CH/HNPJ/2017) PEDV strain-based inactivated vaccine candidates and compared their immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy. The results showed that both vaccine candidates induced high levels of PEDV-specific IgG antibodies and IFN-Œ≥ and reduced the levels of neutralizing antibodies at 21 dpv in suckling piglets. The GIIa-based inactivated vaccine protected all piglets (8/8) against virulent homologous and heterologous virus challenge, while the GIIb strain-based inactivated vaccine protected only 2/4 and 1/4 piglets against virulent homologous and heterologous virus challenge, respectively. Furthermore, antibodies against the GIIa and GIIb strains cross-reacted and cross-neutralized both strains in vitro. Taken together, the data presented in this study indicate that GIIa strain-based inactivated vaccine candidates are more promising than GIIb-based candidates for the development of an effective vaccine against the current highly virulent pandemic PEDV strains.
