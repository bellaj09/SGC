to mask or not to mask children to overcome covid-19. ¬© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.It has been reported that asymptomatic people can transmit the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and become important sources of COVID-19. To reduce the role of asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic people in COVID-19, universal use of face masks in addition to hand hygiene and safety distance seems extremely useful. Consequently, preparing the healthy child to use face masks is strongly needed. To obtain maximal compliance, reasons for mask wearing without attempts of removing must be clearly explained. Moreover, child‚Äôs will must not be forced. Conclusion: On the basis of clinical findings, we think that the universal use of facial masks seems necessary when people have to go out in their everyday lives. In addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face, it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work and school lessons on this issue and other hygiene topics with the main aim to obtain child cooperation.What is Known:‚Ä¢ Asymptomatic people can transmit and become important sources of COVID-19.‚Ä¢ Asymptomatic cases are common also in pediatrics.What is New:‚Ä¢ Universal use of face masks for success against COVID-19 seems necessary also in pediatric age when people have to go out in their everyday lives.‚Ä¢ In addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face, it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work and school lessons with the main aim to obtain child cooperation.
