structural basis for the inhibition of sars-cov-2 main protease by antineoplastic drug carmofur. ¬© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.The antineoplastic drug carmofur is shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Here, the X-ray crystal structure of Mpro in complex with carmofur reveals that the carbonyl reactive group of carmofur is covalently bound to catalytic Cys145, whereas its fatty acid tail occupies the hydrophobic S2 subsite. Carmofur inhibits viral replication in cells (EC50 = 24.30 ŒºM) and is a promising lead compound to develop new antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
