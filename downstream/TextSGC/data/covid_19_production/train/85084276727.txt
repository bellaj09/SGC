All rights reserved.OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current practice and potential strategy in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science were systematically searched using terms including ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù, ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2‚Äù and ‚Äú2019-nCoV‚Äù. After removing duplicates, we then identified articles, letters and commentaries regarding diagnosing COVID-19. RESULTS: Here we summarized relatively mature diagnostic methods like nuclear acid test and computed tomography. Besides, new aspects regarding these detection methods like suitable specimens for nuclear acid test, possible use of 18F-FDG PET/CT were also reported. Especially, we also presented several novel techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 like lung ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) by National Health Commission is recommended to follow as it provides detailed diagnostic procedures using currently available tools. We suggest clinicians further explore the saliva's utility as a specimen for nuclear acid test and the use of lung ultrasound.
