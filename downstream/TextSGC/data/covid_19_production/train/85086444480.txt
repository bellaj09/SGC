guidelines and tools for promoting digital equity. ¬© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This paper aims to provide a targeted overview of relevant digital equity gap literature that serves to contextualize the current crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this review of the literature, the author introduces five guidelines that educators can use to guide their decisions about how to adapt to remote learning. It concludes with an overview and full text of two tools educators and researchers can use to better understand the challenges faced by students: the Digital Equity Gap Interview Protocol and the Digital Equity Gap Survey Instrument. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper is grounded on the theoretical framework of Martha Nussbaum's ‚ÄúCapability Approach,‚Äù which outlines core human capabilities that (if fostered) enable individuals to generate valuable outcomes for themselves. Findings: It is suggested that it is important to attend to human capabilities when addressing digital equity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic. The author provides two tools that are intended to help individuals gather important information about the communities they serve and/or study. Research limitations/implications: Both tools provide descriptive information that will contextualize digital equity gaps, should they be present. Practical implications: This paper provides concrete tools for educators who wish to understand digital equity gaps within the communities they serve. Social implications: In time of unprecedented distance learning, it is important for both K-12 educators and higher education instructors to understand the technological capabilities of their students. The Digital Equity Gap Interview Protocol and the Digital Equity Gap Survey Instrument give them a place to start. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study and address digital equity gaps.
