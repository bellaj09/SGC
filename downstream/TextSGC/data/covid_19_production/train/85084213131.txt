Our priority is to ensure the safety of our patients, the health workers caring for them, and the community in general. At this stage in the pandemic, our information on the use of bronchoscopy in patients of this type is based on the experience of hospitals in other countries, and scientific publications are scarce. The objective of this document is to compile these experiences, based on recommendations from official agencies, in a document offering guidance in daily clinical practice.
