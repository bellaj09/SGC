laboratory readiness and response for novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) in expert laboratories in 30 eu/eea countries, january 2020. ¬© 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus. We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/ probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.
