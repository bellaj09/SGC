pathogenicity of a qx-like strain of infectious bronchitis virus and effects of accessory proteins 3a and 3b in chickens. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.QX-like genotype infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has become prevalent in recent years. Few studies have reported the effects of accessory proteins 3a and 3b on pathogenicity in vivo. We developed a reverse genetics system to manipulate the genome of a QX-like IBV strain IBYZ. Recombinant viruses rIBYZ-ScAUG3a, rIBYZ-ScAUG3b and rIBYZ-ScAUG3ab were generated. These viruses do not express the accessory proteins 3a, 3b, or 3ab due to a mutation in the AUG start codons. In SPF embryonated eggs, the recombinant viruses grew to the same viral load as parental strain rIBYZ. The pathogenicity of rIBYZ and recombinant viruses was examined in 1-day-old SPF chickens. In SPF chickens, rIBYZ-ScAUG3a had a lower mortality than rIBYZ. The clinical signs, gross lesions and histopathological changes of rIBYZ-ScAUG3a group were comparable to those of rIBYZ group. However, viral distribution and viral shedding showed that the viral loads of rIBYZ-ScAUG3a were lower than those of rIBYZ in tissue samples and swab specimens. The rIBYZ-ScAUG3b and rIBYZ-ScAUG3ab strains showed attenuated pathogenicity compared to rIBYZ, as no chickens died and all the parameters tested were considerably low. This study indicates that the absence of accessory proteins 3a and 3b in IBV lead to attenuated pathogenicity in chickens. Protein 3b has a greater effect on pathogenicity than protein 3a. These findings may be used in vaccination trials for the development of a new live-attenuated vaccine.
