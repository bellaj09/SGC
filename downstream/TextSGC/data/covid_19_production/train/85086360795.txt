covid-19 prevention and multiple sclerosis management: the safe pathway for the post-peak. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Background: We hereby report on our experience from Naples (South Italy), where the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already passed. Methods: Assuming that COVID-19 will be circulating until vaccination and/or herd immunity is achieved (possibly not earlier than 2021), we have developed a protocol for the long-term management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Results: We have defined a pathway for the access to the MS Centre with logistic, preventative and clinical recommendations, and have also included 14-day self-isolation and COVID-19 testing before some disease modifying treatments. Discussion: Overall, we believe our experience could be helpful for MS management in the upcoming months.
