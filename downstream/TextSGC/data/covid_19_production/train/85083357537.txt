Copyright ¬© 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.Objectives:To clarify the pandemic status in Western Pacific countries or territories.Methods:The WHO's daily situation reports of COVID-19 were reviewed from January 20, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Changes in the infections, deaths, and the case fatality rate (CFR) in Western Pacific countries or territories were counted.Results:As of March 24, 17 countries or territories had reported the presence of COVID-19 in the Western Pacific Region, 96, 580 people have been infected and a total of 3, 502 deaths. 53.0 % (9/17) of these countries or territories had their first case within two weeks since the WHO's first report, most are China's neighbors with a large and dense population. No other country or territory in this region reported a new infection from January 30 to February 28. However, seven (47.0 %) countries or territories have reported the first cases in three weeks since February 28, almost all are islands. Many countries maintained a small number of infections for a long time after the first report, but a rapid increase occurred later. Deaths occurred in eight countries with a total CFR of 3.63 %, and the CFR varies widely, from 0.39 % (Singapore) to 7.14 % (Philippines).Conclusions:The regional spread of COVID-19 urgently requires an aggressive preparedness for the Western Pacific Islands.
