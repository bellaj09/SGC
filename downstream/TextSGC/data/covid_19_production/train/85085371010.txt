a global effort to define the human genetics of protective immunity to sars-cov-2 infection. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.SARS-CoV-2 infection displays immense inter-individual clinical variability, ranging from silent infection to lethal disease. The role of human genetics in determining clinical response to the virus remains unclear. Studies of outliers‚Äîindividuals remaining uninfected despite viral exposure and healthy young patients with life-threatening disease‚Äîpresent a unique opportunity to reveal human genetic determinants of infection and disease.¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.SARS-CoV-2 infection displays immense inter-individual clinical variability, ranging from silent infection to lethal disease.
