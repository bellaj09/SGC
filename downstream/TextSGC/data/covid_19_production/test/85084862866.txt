designing a resilient supply chain: an approach to reduce drug shortages in epidemic outbreaks. ¬© 2020 Jose Antonio Lozano-Diez et al., licensed to EAI.INTRODUCTION: Supply network design is a long-studied topic that has evolved to address disruptive situations. The risk of supply chain disruption leads to the development of resilient supply chains that are capable of reacting effectively. OBJECTIVES: In the context of public health, drug supply networks face shortage challenges in many situations, such as current epidemic outbreaks such as COVID-19. Drug shortages can occur due to manufacturing problems, lack of infrastructure, and immediate reaction mechanisms. METHODS: The case study is solved with anyLogistix optimization and simulation software. RESULTS: We present the results of a hypothetical study on the impact of COVID-19 on a regional supply network. The results of this research are intended to be the basis for the design of resilient supply chains in epidemic outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Drug providers should consider strategies to prevent or reduce the impact of shortages as well as disruption spreads.
