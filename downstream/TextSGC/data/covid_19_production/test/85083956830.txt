tracheostomy in the covid-19 pandemic. ¬© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: The role of tracheostomy in COVID-19-related ARDS is unknown. Nowadays, there is no clear indication regarding the timing of tracheostomy in these patients. Methods: We describe our synergic experience between ENT and ICU Departments at University Hospital of Modena underlining some controversial aspects that would be worth discussing tracheostomies in these patients. During the last 2 weeks, we performed 28 tracheostomies on patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection who were treated with IMV. Results: No differences between percutaneous and surgical tracheostomy in terms of timing and no case of team virus infection. Conclusion: In our experience, tracheostomy should be performed only in selected patients within 7- and 14-day orotracheal intubation.
