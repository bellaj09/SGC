incorporating issues of elderly loneliness into the covid-19 public health response. Copyright ¬© 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.As the systems that people depend on are increasingly strained by the COVID-19 outbreak, public health impacts are manifesting in different ways beyond morbidity and mortality for elderly populations. Loneliness is already a chief public health concern that is being made worse by COVID-19.
