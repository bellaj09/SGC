sars-cov-2 infection, clinical features and outcome of covid-19 in united kingdom nursing homes. ¬© 2020Objectives: To understand SARS-Co-V-2 infection and transmission in UK nursing homes in order to develop preventive strategies for protecting the frail elderly residents. Methods: An outbreak investigation involving 394 residents and 70 staff, was carried out in 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Two point-prevalence surveys were performed one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Results: Overall, 26% (95% CI 22‚Äì31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70‚Äì336) compared with previous years. Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35‚Äì46) of residents as positive for SARS-CoV-2, and of these 43% (95% CI 34‚Äì52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11‚Äì24) had only atypical symptoms; 4% (95% CI ‚àí1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff also tested positive. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in four UK nursing homes was associated with very high infection and mortality rates. Many residents developed either atypical or had no discernible symptoms. A number of asymptomatic staff members also tested positive, suggesting a role for regular screening of both residents and staff in mitigating future outbreaks.
