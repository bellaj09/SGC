Although feline viral diseases can pose serious health hazards to pet cats, commercialized preventative vaccines are lacking. Interferons (IFNs), especially type I IFNs (IFN-Œ±, IFN-Œ≤, and interferon omega (IFN-œâ)), have been explored as effective therapeutic drugs against viral diseases in cats. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge regarding feline IFN-œâ (feIFN-œâ), compared to IFN-ct and IFN-Œ≤. In this study, we cloned the genes encoding feIFN-œâa and feIFN-œâb from cat spleen lymphocytes. Homology and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these two genes belonged to new subtypes of feIFN-œâ. The recombinant feIFN-œâa and feIFN-œâb proteins were expressed in their soluble forms in Escherichia coli, followed by purification. Both proteins exhibited effective anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) activity in Vero, F81 (feline kidney cell), Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells, showing broader cross-species antiviral activity than the INTERCAT IFN antiviral drug. Furthermore, the recombinant feIFN-œâa and feIFN-œâb proteins demonstrated antiviral activity against VSV, feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine parvovirus (CPV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), indicating better broad-spectrum antiviral activity than the INTERCAT IFN. The two novel feIFN-œâ proteins (feIFN-œâa and feIFN-œâb) described in this study show promising potential to serve as effective therapeutic agents for treating viral infections in pet cats.
