the recommendations of the brazilian college of surgeons and the brazilian bariatric and metabolic surgery societies on the return of bariatric and metabolic operations in geographic regions of the country where the procedures have been allowed by local policies, in the period of covid-19 pandemic. Prioritizing surgical procedures aims at facilitating patient's access according to the clinical needs, maximizing access equity, and minimizing the damage from delayed access. Previous categorization of elective bariatric surgery have been adapted to define an objective prioritizing system that reflects those principles for bariatric and metabolic operations. Given the factors that contribute to the morbidity and mortality of obese and type 2 diabetes patients, surgical prioritization should be based on clinical risk stratification. For patients with type 2 diabetes, we suggest that the operation may be prioritized for those with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in a relatively short term. Likewise, it is necessary to guide the surgical team regarding the necessary care both in the pre, per and postoperative periods of bariatric and metabolic surgery. These recommendations aim to reduce the risk of in-hospital contamination of the surgical team among health professionals and between health professionals and patients. In summary, these recommendations have been shaped after a thorough analysis of the available literature and are extremely important to mitigate the harm related to the clinical complications of obesity and its comorbidities while keeping healthcare providers' and patients' safety.
