the within-host viral kinetics of sars-cov-2. ¬© 2020 the Author(s).In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in the host. Chest radiograph score data are used to estimate the parameters of that model. Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is around 3:79. Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of MERS virus is 8:16 which is higher than SARS-CoV-2. The PRCC method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters. Moreover, the drug effects on virus growth and immunity effect of patients are also implemented to analyze the model.
