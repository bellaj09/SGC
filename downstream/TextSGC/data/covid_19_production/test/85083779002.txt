routine immunization services during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. ¬© 2020, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine. All rights reserved.Routine immunizations (RI) keep the infectious diseases under control in the community. However, during the coronavirus pandemic, to prevent the associated exponential rise in the number of cases, it became necessary to stop routine health services across the country. Routine Immunization also had to be discontinued. It is to be realized however that the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases is gradually increasing in direct proportion to the delay in administering vaccinations to eligible children. It‚Äôs likely that we will face outbreaks of VPD if we keep RI halted for weeks together. Various dimensions of RI need to be examined from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic ranging from vaccine hesitancy to operationalization of services. In this article, we highlight this hidden problem, which has the potential to further challenge our already challenged health and healthcare-related situation. The domains which deserve careful consideration are discussed to supporting policymakers in making informed decisions in this regard.
