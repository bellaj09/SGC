reducing transmission of covid-19 using a continuous negative pressure operative field barrier during oral maxillofacial surgery. ¬© 2020Oral and maxillofacial surgery in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, presents a high risk of exposure and cross contamination to the operative room personnel. We designed, simulated and implemented a continue negative pressure operative field barrier to provide an additional layer of protection, using standard equipment readily available in most operative rooms during oral and maxillofacial procedures.
