reply to "acute urticaria with pyrexia as the first manifestations of a covid-19 infection": urticaria-like lesions in covid-19 patients are not really urticaria. a case with clinicopathologic correlation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.We have read with great attention the article by Van Damme et al. considering urticarial lesions as a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated skin manifestation1 . They observed two patients with erythemato-edematous lesions surrounded by whitish halo, thus similar to hives but without additional data on their evolution1 . A previous report of COVID19-related urticarial lesions had also been first published by Recalcati2 . However, none of these two published articles detailed if the lesions where evanescent, as it is mandatory for urticaria, nor did a pathological study.
