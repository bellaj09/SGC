Through study-ing the literature, interpreting official documents, analyzing medical and social managemendata, we summarized and compared some powerful measures taken by the Chinese govern-ment, such as declaring emergency state, blocking down the epidemic center, prohibiting crowd gathering activities, forcing residents to wear masks, and mobilizing medical staff and products. We found that these unconventional measures, on the one hand, controlled thspread of the epidemic in China, and on the other hand, exposed some of China‚Äôs short-comings in biosafety, food safety, public health input, and emergency system constructionThis paper also recommends that other countries should take strict isolation measures aearly as possible when fighting COVID-19 epidemics, and also mobilize citizens to strengthen self-protection.
