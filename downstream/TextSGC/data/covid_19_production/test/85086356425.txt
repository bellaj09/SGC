impact of covid-19 on reperfusion strategies for acute coronary syndromes impacto de la contingencia sanitaria por covid-19 en las estrategias de reperfusi√≥n del s√≠ndrome coronario agudo. ¬© 2020 Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog√≠a Ignacio Chavez. Publicado por Permanyer.Reperfusion therapy is a measure of care in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which should be per-formed once we have the diagnosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention is considered the gold standard, however in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reperfusion strategy is more focused on fibrinolytic therapy due to the shorter time required to perform and less exposure. This pandemic represents a contact problem in health personnel, since cases are increasing worldwide, so it is important to know the measures that must be followed to avoid coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
