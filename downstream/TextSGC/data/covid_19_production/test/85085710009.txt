efficacy of hydrogel patches in preventing facial skin damage caused by mask compression in fighting against coronavirus disease-2019: a short-term, self-controlled study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.During the recent ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, healthcare workers around the world are fighting at the front lines of this epidemic, as well as the dermatologists. Our previous research revealed that long-term wearing of N95 masks could lead to various facial skin lesions, which might affect their routine work and mental health. More importantly, severe skin lesions (e.g. ulcers) might put them in danger of being infected. Generally, hydrogels have been used to treat patients with pressure ulcers.
