greta's wrath; or qu√©date en casa, agamben: covid-19 and the (non-)state of exception a ira de greta; ou qu√©date en casa, agamben: covid-19 e o (n√£o-)estado de exce√ß√£o la ira de greta; o qu√©date en casa, agamben: covid-19 y el (no-)estado de excepci√≥n. ¬© 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid. All rights reserved.This essay examines the usefulness (or not) of Agamben's notion of the state of exception as a framework for understanding the drastic changes to social life brought on by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. It also considers a number of alternative interpretations - of metaphysical or divine inspiration. COVID-19 has brought on much confusion, and this essay might or might not contribute to dissipating some of it. As always, it's best to wash our hands.
