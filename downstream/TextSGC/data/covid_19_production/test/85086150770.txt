technology and the sustainable tourist in the new age of disruption. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.We are in the midst of a transition into a new age of travel and tourism based on the convergence of several key disruptive influences in the form of new technologies, periodic chaos in markets and economies, health and safety concerns, and environmental crises. How we navigate these disruptive influences is important for the enjoyment of tourists, the success of tourism service providers and other local people, and the integrity of the natural world. The purpose of this research note is to discuss a surrogate ecotour experience that allows tourists to remain home while employing local guides to facilitate personalised, interactive, real-time tours (PIRTs). It is argued that there is a market for this type of experience for persons with disabilities and the elderly who have accessibility needs, and for the sustainable citizen who wishes to minimise his/her impact on the planet.
