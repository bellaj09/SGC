the immune response of young turkeys to haemorrhagic enteritis virus infection at different levels and sources of methionine in the diet. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Haemorrhagic enteritis (HE) of turkeys was first described in 1937 in the USA, while in Poland it was first diagnosed in 1987. Polish haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) isolates are usually low pathogenic and trigger a subclinical disease. Unfortunately, even the low- pathogenic HEV strains cause severe immunosuppression leading to secondary bacterial infections and huge economic losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the influence of Met on HEV infected turkeys immune response can be differentiated by both its level and source. Met is one of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role but also participate in and regulate key metabolic pathways and immune response. In our study, the birds were assigned to 4 dietary treatments which differed in Met levels (0.55 and 0.78% in weeks 1-4 of age and 0.45 and 0.65% in weeks 5-8 of age, respectively) and sources (DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA)). Results: The HEV added the percentage of CD4+ cells and decreased the percentage of IgM+ cells in the blood, spleen and caecal tonsils (CTs) of turkeys. In addition, it increased the percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells in blood, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in plasma. The higher dose of Met led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+IL-6+ cell subpopulations in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys and to an increase in the percentage of IgM+ B cells in CTs. Turkeys administered feeds with an increased Met content displayed a decrease in plasma IL-6 levels and an increase in plasma IgA levels. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that HEV infection impairs the immune function in turkeys. Met content in the feed has a moderate effect on the immune response in HEV-infected turkeys. The source of this amino acid appears not be as important as its dose, because value of the analysed parameters did not differ significantly between turkeys receiving feeds with DLM or MHA. In the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% (than recommended by NRC) level of Met in the feeds had a positive effect on humoral immunity parameters.
