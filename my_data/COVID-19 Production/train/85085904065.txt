associations of hypertension with the severity and fatality of sars-cov-2 infection: a meta-analysis. ¬© 2020 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.Hypertensionisa common comorbidity in COVID-19patients. However, the associationsof hypertension with the severityand fatality ofCOVID-19 remainunclear.In the present meta-Analysis, relevant studies reported the impacts of hypertensionon SARS-CoV-2 infectionwereidentifiedby searching PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, Web of science, Wiley Online Library, Embaseand CNKIup to Mar 20th2020. As the results shown, twelvepublications with 2389 COVID-19 patients (674 severe cases) were included for the analysis of disease severity.The severity rate of COVID-19 in hypertensive patients was much higher than innon-hypertensive cases (37.58% vs 19.73%, pooled OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.80-2.86). Moreover, the pooled ORs of COVID-19 severity for hypertensionversus non-hypertensionwas 2.21 (95%CI: 1.58-3.10) and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.70-3.17) in age < 50 years and ‚â•50 years patients, respectively. Additionally, six studies with151 deaths of2116 COVID-19 caseswere included for the analysis of diseasefatality.The resultsshowedthat hypertensive patients carried a nearly 3.48-fold higherrisk of dying from COVID-19 (95% CI: 1.72-7.08). Meanwhile, the pooled ORs of COVID-19 fatality for hypertensionversus non-hypertensionwas 6.43 (95% CI: 3.40-12.17) and 2.66 (95% CI:1.27-5.57) in age < 50 years and ‚â•50 years patients, respectively. Neither considerableheterogeneity nor publication bias was observed in the present analysis.Therefore, our present results provided further evidence that hypertension could significantly increase therisksof severity and fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
