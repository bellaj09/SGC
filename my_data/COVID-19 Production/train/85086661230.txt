when time falls apart: the public health implications of distorted time perception in the age of covid-19. ¬© 2020 American Psychological Association.Collective trauma, like the COVID-19 pandemic, can dramatically alter how we perceive time and view our futures.

In this commentary, we review existing literature on time perception in the context of stress and trauma and discuss its implications for mental health and well-being.
