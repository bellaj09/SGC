the more things change, the more they stay the same: teaching philosophy statements and the state of student learning. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.In association with the republishing of our 2009 papers, we revisit the core ideas about teaching philosophy papers, considering how the ideas have evolved and offering possible questions for future research on teaching philosophy statements.

The rapid changes initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic offer a timely opportunity to revisit and reflect upon one‚Äôs teaching philosophy statement, since some of the improvisations faculty develop are likely to stimulate new teaching practices.
