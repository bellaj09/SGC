diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients after an oncological pet/ct diagn√≥stico de neumon√≠a covid-19 en pacientes asintom√°ticos tras la realizaci√≥n de un pet/tc oncol√≥gico. ¬© 2020 Sociedad Espa√±ola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen MolecularIntroduction: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the pandemic caused by a new coronavirus. There are some oncological indications that have special priority and studies are still being carried out despite the current situation. In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. Material and methods: Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: During the specified period, a total of 129 PET/CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET/CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET/CT studies.
