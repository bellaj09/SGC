the microbiological characteristics of lower respiratory tract infection in patients with neuromuscular disorders: an investigation based on a multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect viruses and a clone library analysis of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequence in sputum samples. ¬© 2019We performed gene amplification methods for the detections of bacteria and viruses using sputum samples to clarify the microbiological characteristics of lower respiratory tract infection in patients with neuromuscular disorders. The tendencies of higher proportion of respiratory virus detection and lower diversity of bacteria in sputum were observed.
