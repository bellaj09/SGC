response to ‚Äúlupus anticoagulant is frequent in patients with covid-19‚Äù. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the letter from Dr. In√®s Harzallah, et al. Antiphospholipid antibody assays including lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin and anti‚ÄìŒ≤2-glycoprotein I have also been performed in dozens of our patients, however, very few of them got positive results, we don't think that antiphospholipid antibody exists universally in COVID-19 patients. In addition, two of the three reported cases with antiphospholipid antibodies mentioned in the letter [1] also seem to meet the International Society on Haemostasis and Thrombosis (ISTH) criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation [2], the causality between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis in these cases is still uncertain.
