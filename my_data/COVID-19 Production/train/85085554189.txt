evaluation of ncov-qs (mico biomed) for rt-qpcr detection of sars-cov-2 from nasopharyngeal samples using cdc fda eua qpcr kit as a gold standard: an example of the need of validation studies. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Background: Several qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mostly lacking of evaluation due to covid19 emergency. Objective: We evaluated nCoV-QS (MiCo BioMed) kit using CDC kit as gold standard. Results: We found limitations for nCoV-QS: 1) lower sensitivity 2) lack of RNA quality control probe. Conclusions: Validation studies should be implemented for any SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR commercial kit to prevent unreliable diagnosis.
