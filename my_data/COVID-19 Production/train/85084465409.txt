covid-19 in people living with human immunodeficiency virus: a case series of 33 patients. ¬© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Introduction: Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still scarce. This case series of 33 PLWH patients with COVID-19 reveals symptoms and outcome in this special population. Methods: Retrospective analysis of anonymized data including age, gender, HIV-associated parameters, symptoms, and outcome. Results: Three out of 32 patients with documented outcomes died (9%). 91% of the patients recovered and 76% have been classified as mild cases. All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir. Conclusions: This preliminary case series does not support excess morbidity and mortality among symptomatic COVID-19 PLWH and with viral suppression on ART. SARS-CoV-2 infections may occur during boosted darunavir-based and/or on tenofovir-containing ART.
