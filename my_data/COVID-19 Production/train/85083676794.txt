chinese bioethicists speak out on covid-19, and others follow. ¬© 2020 The Hastings CenterShortly after Wuhan, the city where the novel coronavirus was first identified, was placed on lockdown in January, I received an email from two Hastings Center fellows in China: Renzong Qiu, of Renmin University of China in Beijing, and Ruipeng Lei, of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. Attached was a post for our blog, Hastings Bioethics Forum, that raised ethical and legal questions about China's response. ‚ÄúHegel says, ‚ÄòWe learn from history that we do not learn from history,‚Äô‚Äù their piece began. ‚ÄúThe recurrence of the coronavirus epidemic in China proves his insight to be right.‚Äù This bold report from bioethicists in China was courageous and eye-opening. It was among the first discussions in bioethics of what has since become a global crisis, and it turned out to be the first in a string of commentaries in Hastings Bioethics Forum with insights about the crisis, the issues it raises, and how the world should respond to it.
