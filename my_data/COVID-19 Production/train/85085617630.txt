conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections (croi) 2020: march 8-11, 2020. Copyright ¬© 2020 Clarivate Analytics.The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus SAR-CoV-2, and the disease it causes known as COVID-19, resulted in this years' annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) being held virtually, with presentations being made via webcasts and posters available online. This did not prevent the conference from providing its usual high-quality data to its participants including basic, translational and clinical researchers from around the world covering developments and research methods in the ongoing battle against HIV/AIDS and related infectious diseases. Adapting to the unique situation, CROI also held a special session on the COVID-19 virus, with experts providing the information on current knowledge of the outbreak and its causative pathogen. At the time of the conference, the virus had affected over 110,000 people from over 110 countries and treatments and vaccines are yet to be discovered.
