detection of low levels of sars-cov-2 rna from nasopharyngeal swabs using three commercial molecular assays. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been rapidly developed and broadly deployed in laboratories worldwide. Although these assays have been reported to correlate well, we sought to compare the Xpert¬Æ Xpress SARS-CoV-2 to the cobas¬Æ SARS-CoV-2 or the Lightmix¬Æ Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene assay for nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs with low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thirty-seven NP swabs were studied, including 10 samples with a moderate cycle threshold (Ct) between 30‚Äì33.9, and 22 with Ct‚â•34, and 5 negative for SARS-CoV-2. Overall concordance on initial comparison was 86.5 % (32/37), which was 100 % concordance for samples with Ct values ranging between 30‚àí33.9. Discordance amongst samples showing a Ct ‚â•34 was 22.7 % (5/22). Endpoint value analysis on the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 within the discordant samples noted two with an endpoint value >5, which were detected by the cobas¬Æ or Lightmix¬Æ. Testing of SARS-CoV-2 on the three commercial assays was comparable for NP swabs with moderate Ct values, while high Ct values were less concordant. Importantly, analysis of Xpert¬Æ endpoint values improved interpretation of discrepant results.
