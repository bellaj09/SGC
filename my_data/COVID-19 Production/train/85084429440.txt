Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Essential oils have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses. In this work we hypothesized that essential oil components may interact with key protein targets of the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2). A molecular docking analysis was carried out using 171 essential oil components with SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 main protease (SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 Mpro), SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 endoribonucleoase (SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 Nsp15/NendoU), SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 ADP‚àíribose‚àí1‚Ä≥‚àíphosphatase (SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 ADRP), SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 RNA‚àídependent RNA polymerase (SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 RdRp), the binding domain of the SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 spike protein (SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 rS), and human angiotensin‚àíconverting enzyme (hACE2). The compound with the best normalized docking score to SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 Mpro was the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (E)‚àíŒ≤‚àífarnesene. The best docking ligands for SARS‚àíCoV Nsp15/NendoU were (E,E)‚àíŒ±‚àífarnesene, (E)‚àíŒ≤‚àífarnesene, and (E,E)‚àífarnesol. (E,E)‚àíFarnesol showed the most exothermic docking to SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 ADRP. Unfortunately, the docking energies of (E,E)‚àíŒ±‚àífarnesene, (E)‚àíŒ≤‚àífarnesene, and (E,E)‚àífarnesol with SARS‚àíCoV‚àí2 targets were relatively weak compared to docking energies with other proteins and are, therefore, unlikely to interact with the virus targets. However, essential oil components may act synergistically, essential oils may potentiate other antiviral agents, or they may provide some relief of COVID‚àí19 symptoms.
