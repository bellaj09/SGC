diagnostic performance of seven rapid igg/igm antibody tests and the euroimmun iga/igg elisa in covid-19 patients. ¬© 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious DiseasesObjectives: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of seven rapid IgG/IgM tests and the Euroimmun IgA/IgG ELISA for antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Specificity was evaluated in 103 samples collected before January 2020. Sensitivity and time to seropositivity was evaluated in 167 samples from 94 patients with COVID-19 confirmed with RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Results: Specificity (confidence interval) of lateral flow assays (LFAs) was ‚â•91.3% (84.0‚Äì95.5) for IgM, ‚â•90.3% (82.9‚Äì94.8) for IgG, and ‚â•85.4% (77.2‚Äì91.1) for the combination IgM OR IgG. Specificity of the ELISA was 96.1% (90.1‚Äì98.8) for IgG and only 73.8% (64.5‚Äì81.4) for IgA. Sensitivity 14‚Äì25 days after the onset of symptoms was between ‚â•92.1% (78.5‚Äì98.0) and 100% (95.7‚Äì100) for IgG LFA compared to 89.5% (75.3‚Äì96.4) for IgG ELISA. Positivity of IgM OR IgG for LFA resulted in a decrease in specificity compared to IgG alone without a gain in diagnostic performance, except for VivaDiag. The results for IgM varied significantly between the LFAs with an average overall agreement of only 70% compared to 89% for IgG. The average dynamic trend to seropositivity for IgM was not shorter than for IgG. At the time of hospital admission the sensitivity of LFA was <60%. Conclusions: Sensitivity for the detection of IgG antibodies 14‚Äì25 days after the onset of symptoms was ‚â•92.1% for all seven LFAs compared to 89.5% for the IgG ELISA. The results for IgM varied significantly, and including IgM antibodies in addition to IgG for the interpretation of LFAs did not improve the diagnostic performance.
