evaluation of the edi enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of sars-cov-2 igm and igg antibodies in human plasma. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Background: Besides SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, serological testing is emerging as additional option in COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim of this study was to evaluate novel immunoassays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human plasma. Methods: Using EDITM Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), we measured SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in 64 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with serial blood samples (n = 104) collected at different time points from symptom onset. Blood samples from 200 healthy blood donors and 256 intensive care unit (ICU) patients collected before the COVID-19 outbreak were also used. Results: The positivity rates in the COVID-19 patients were 5.9% for IgM and 2.9% for IgG ‚â§ 5 days after symptom onset; Between day 5 and day 10 the positivity rates were 37.1% for IgM and 37.1% for IgG and rose to 76.4% for IgM and 82.4% for IgG after > 10‚Äì15 days. After 15‚Äì22 days the ‚Äútrue‚Äù positivity rates were 94.4% for IgM and 100% for IgG. The ‚Äúfalse‚Äù positivity rates were 0.5% for IgM and 1.0% for IgG in the healthy blood donors, 1.6% for IgM and 1.2% for IgG in ICU patients. Conclusions: This study shows high ‚Äútrue‚Äù vs. low ‚Äúfalse‚Äù positivity rates for the EDITM SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISAs.
