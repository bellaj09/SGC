For that reason, Cardiovascular Surgery Departments need to develop a functional plan of contingency within the global framework formulated by the instructions of the Ministry of Health and hospital authorities. The aim of this strategy is the proper functioning of Cardiovascular Surgery Departments: a) Correct care for urgent and emerging patients. b) The preparation of a list of preferred patients and temporary treatment criteria. c) The justified and safe delay of elective patients if their pathology and clinical situation allow it. d) The concrete application of ECMO programs in the COVID-19 context.
