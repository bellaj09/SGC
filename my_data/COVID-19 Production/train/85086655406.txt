a fractional differential equation model for the covid-19 transmission by using the caputo‚Äìfabrizio derivative. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).We present a fractional-order model for the COVID-19 transmission with Caputo‚ÄìFabrizio derivative. Using the homotopy analysis transform method (HATM), which combines the method of homotopy analysis and Laplace transform, we solve the problem and give approximate solution in convergent series. We prove the existence of a unique solution and the stability of the iteration approach by using fixed point theory. We also present numerical results to simulate virus transmission and compare the results with those of the Caputo derivative.
