role of neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio in the mortality of males diagnosed with covid-19. ¬© 2020, Tehran University of Medical Science. All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: With this study, for the first time among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the neutro-phil-lymphocyte-ratios of men and women were compared. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with 80 patients and the data was gained retrospectively on the electronic documents of the hospital. Results: The neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio was statistically significant and higher in the male than the women for all ages and geriatric patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: The higher neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio in older males diagnosed with COVID-19 could be a causative reason for the higher mortality rates in men. We hope that these findings would be helpful for further studies.
