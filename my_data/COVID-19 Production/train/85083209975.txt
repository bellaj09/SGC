All rights reserved.COVID-19 as an emerging disease has spread to 183 countries and territories worldwide up to March 20, 2020. The first COVID-19 case (i.e.The index case) in Iran was observed in the city of Qom on February 19, 2020. One of the cities of Markazi Province is Delijan which shares a border with Qom. Consequently, COVID-19 has quickly spread in this city because a large population commutes daily between the two cities. This study aimed to report the challenges and considerations of community-based preparedness at the onset of COVID-19 outbreak in a city of Iran in 2020.
