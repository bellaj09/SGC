high-resolution computed tomography manifestations of covid-19 infections in patients of different ages. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.Purpose: We aimed to compare chest HRCT lung signs identified in scans of differently aged patients with COVID-19 infections. Methods: Case data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China were collected, and chest HRCT signs of infected patients in four age groups (<18 years, 18‚Äì44 years, 45‚Äì59 years, ‚â•60 years) were compared. Results: Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Patients aged 45‚Äì59 years and aged ‚â•60 years had more bilateral lung, lung lobe, and lung field involvement, and greater lesion numbers than patients <18 years. GGO accompanied with the interlobular septa thickening or a crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and air bronchogram sign were more common in patients aged 45‚Äì59 years, and ‚â•60 years, than in those aged <18 years, and aged 18‚Äì44 years. Conclusions: Chest HRCT manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are related to patient's age, and HRCT signs may be milder in younger patients.
