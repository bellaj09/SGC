a nicotinic hypothesis for covid-19 with preventive and therapeutic implications une hypoth√®se nicotinique pour covid 19 et ses implications pr√©ventives et th√©rapeutiques. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

There is a pressing urgency to find treatments based upon currently available scientific knowledge. Therefore, we tentatively propose a hypothesis which hopefully might ultimately help save lives. Based on the current scientific literature and on new epidemiological data which reveal that current smoking status appears to be a protective factor against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 [1], we hypothesize that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 infection and might represent a target for the prevention and control of Covid-19 infection.
