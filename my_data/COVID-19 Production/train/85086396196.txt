the possible pathophysiology mechanism of cytokine storm in elderly adults with covid-19 infection: the contribution of ‚Äúinflame-aging‚Äù. ¬© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Purpose: Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is emerged in Wuhan, and recently become worldwide pandemic. Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is characterized by ‚Äúinflamm-aging‚Äù. It is highly likely that ‚Äúinflamm-aging‚Äù is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic search in the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, senescent cell, cytokine storm, inflame-aging, ACE2 receptor, autophagy, and Vitamin D. Electronic database searches combined and duplicates were removed. Results: The aim of the present review was to summarize experimental data and clinical observations that linked the pathophysiology mechanisms of ‚Äúinflamm-aging‚Äù, mild-grade inflammation, and cytokine storm in some elderly adults with severe COVID-19 infection.
