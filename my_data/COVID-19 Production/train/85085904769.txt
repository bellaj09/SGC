pediatric peri-operative care in the covid-19 era. ¬© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.COVID-19 has impacted the United States substantially. The virus, unlike other recent epidemics, has resulted in the closing of many schools, businesses, and healthcare facilities. Much of the virus's impact is yet to be determined, however, what has been observed is that children are much less affected than adults and their case fatality is low across the world. Although the adults who care for children at home and in healthcare settings may be at risk, there are many strategies that are being implemented across the nation to address viral spread and move toward business as usual. Government policies that are currently being developed should consider the impact they will have on public health and the economy because they are both intimately intertwined in the daily workings of our nation. We urge consideration of the longterm impact that the pandemic may have on children. Furthermore, we insist that public and private institutions at all levels consider policies and programs that account for children and the indirect and direct deleterious effects that the pandemic is having on their development and well-being. Children in need of surgery have different considerations compared with adult patients with regard to decision-making, convalescence, and long-term outcomes. As children are our future, let us consider mitigation strategies and solutions that can give them the best chance at success.
