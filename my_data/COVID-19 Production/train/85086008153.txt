umbilical cord blood therapy to prevent progression of covid-19 related pneumonia: a structured summary of a study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).Objectives: Objective: To undertake a pilot, feasibility RCT of umbilical cord blood derived cell therapy for treatment of adult patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus related moderate-to-severe pneumonia to prevent progression to severe ARDS. Hypothesis: Expanded cord blood derived cell therapy will be feasible, well tolerated and show potential efficacy in the treatment of acute COVID-19 related moderate to severe pneumonia in adult patients because of their powerful anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Trial design: Pilot, parallel design randomised controlled trial. Participants: The trial will recruit 24 hospitalised patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pneumonia from July to December 2020 at Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne, Australia. Intervention and comparator: Intervention: Intravenous injection of expanded umbilical cord blood cells at a dose of 5 million cells/kg (maximum dose - 500 million cells). Cell infusion will occur over 30-60 minutes through a peripheral intravenous cannula. Standard supportive care will continue as needed. Comparator: Standard supportive care. Main outcomes: Safety and tolerability of cell administration within first 24 hours of administration; clinical improvement on a seven-category clinical improvement ordinal scale. Randomisation: Randomisation will be done using computer generated allocation to intervention/ control groups in a 1:1 ratio (in blocks of 6) using sealed opaque envelopes. Blinding (masking): This will be an unblinded study, given that it is the first study using expanded cord blood cells in COVID-19 patients. There will be no placebo infusion. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Twelve participants in each group. Total n=24. Trial Status: CBC-19 protocol v2, dated 23rd April 2020. Recruitment has not started yet. Estimated recruitment timeline is between 1st July - 31st December 2020. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12620000478910, registered 16th April 2020. Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).
