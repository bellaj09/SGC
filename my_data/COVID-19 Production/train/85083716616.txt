The current COVID-19 epidemics may compromise their care at several levels: difficulties to access to hospitals mainly focused on treating COVID-19 patients, possible lack of nurses at home, strong reduction of visits by homecare providers, tended flow or lack of hand sanitizers, surgical masks and pumps. The aim of these recommendations put together by the French-speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM)‚Äôs Home Artificial Nutrition Committee is to define in terms of healthcare resources the minimum care to provide to these patients. We also aim to help cope with the possible tensions, in order to secure the care we must provide to home artificial nutrition patients during this crisis.
