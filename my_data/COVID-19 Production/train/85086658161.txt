aging veterans' mental health and well-being in the context of covid-19: the importance of social ties during physical distancing. ¬© 2020 American Psychological Association.Prior wartime trauma likely acts as a double-edged sword that promotes both aging veterans' vulnerability and resilience in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. During this stressful time, aging veterans may benefit from having an array of socially supportive network ties. We therefore suggest that clinicians working with veterans encourage veterans to (a) create or sustain positive social connections while maintaining physical distance and (b) call upon coping strategies that helped them manage past difficulties.
