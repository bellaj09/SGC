novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) early-stage importation risk to europe, january 2020. ¬© 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.
