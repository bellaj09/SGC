Under this scenario, the interferon-Œ≤ 1a (IFN-Œ≤ 1a) whose antiviral potential is already known, and is a drug currently used in the clinical management of multiple sclerosis, may represent as a potential candidate. In this report, we demonstrate that IFN-Œ≤ 1a was highly effective in inhibiting in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication at clinically achievable concentration when administered after virus infection.
