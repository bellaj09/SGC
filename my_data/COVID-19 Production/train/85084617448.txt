effect of ambient air pollutants and meteorological variables on covid-19 incidence. ¬© 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.ObjectiveTo understand whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological variables are associated with daily COVID-19 incidence.DesignA retrospective cohort during Jan 25th to Feb 29th in 2020.SettingCity of Wuhan, XiaoGan and HuangGang.PatientsThe COVID-19 incidence per day.MethodsWe collected daily data of COVID-19 incidence, eight ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3-8h) and three meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity and wind level) in China's three worst COVID-19 hit cities during the study period. The multivariate Poisson regression was performed to understand their correlation.ResultsOur data showed that daily COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with PM2.5 and humidity in all cities. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of PM2.5 was 1.036 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032-1.039), 1.059 (95% CL, 1.046-1.072) and 1.144 (95% CL, 1.12-1.169) for COVID-19 incidence per day in Wuhan, XiaoGan and HuangGang, respectively. The RR of humidity was constantly lower than that of PM2.5, whose difference ranged from 0.027 to 0.111. Moreover, PM10 and temperature also exhibited a notable correlation with daily COVID-19 incidence, but in a negative pattern The RR of PM10 raged from 0.915 (95% CL, 0.896-0.934) to 0.961 (95% CL, 0.95-0.972) while that of temperature was 0.738 (95% CL, 0.717-0.759) to 0.969 (95% CL, 0.966-0.973).ConclusionsOur data suggested that PM2.5/humidity and PM10/temperature could substantially increase and decrease the risk of COVID-19 incidence, respectively.
