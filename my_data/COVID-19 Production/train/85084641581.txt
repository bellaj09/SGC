playing into stereotypes: engaging millennials and generation z in the covid-19 pandemic response. ¬© 2020 The AuthorsThe turning point in the United States‚Äô response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic occurred in March, the time of the year where young people are most looking forward to spring break, graduation, and warmer weather. News reports abounded of young people flouting local and state ordinances related to social distancing, and concerns about millennial and Generation Z's responses to these measures led to stereotyping and finger-pointing that disregarded the breadth of experiences within these generations. We suggest that the unique experiences and skills of millennials and Generation Z will allow them to make important contributions towards navigating the ever-changing post-coronavirus disease world. Engaging all generations in the pandemic response will leverage intergenerational innovation and optimize the response to coronavirus disease 2019 together.
