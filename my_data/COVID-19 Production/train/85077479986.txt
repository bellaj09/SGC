treatment of middle east respiratory syndrome with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-Œ≤1b (miracle trial): statistical analysis plan for a recursive two-stage group sequential randomized controlled trial. The MIRACLE trial (MERS-CoV Infection tReated with A Combination of Lopinavir/ritonavir and intErferon-Œ≤1b) investigates the efficacy of a combination therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir and recombinant interferon-Œ≤1b provided with standard supportive care, compared to placebo provided with standard supportive care, in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS. The MIRACLE trial is designed as a recursive, two-stage, group sequential, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial. The aim of this article is to describe the statistical analysis plan for the MIRACLE trial. The primary outcome is 90-day mortality. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The MIRACLE trial is the first randomized controlled trial for MERS treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02845843. Registered on 27 July 2016.
