adapting to a global pandemic through live virtual delivery of a cancer collaborative trial group conference: the trog 2020 experience. ¬© 2020 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of RadiologistsIntroduction: The global COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the TROG 2020 face to face Annual Scientific Meeting (ASM). It was instead delivered as a live virtual meeting with 6 days of planning. Here, we report the participants‚Äô experience of this live virtual meeting. Method: Participants were invited to complete custom-developed, pre- and post-meeting surveys to assess their expectations of and satisfaction with the live virtual format. Speakers and moderators were also invited to complete a custom-developed satisfaction survey. The working parties of TROG (head/neck/skin, genitourinary, breast and lung) were also sampled. Results: In total, 188/273 (69%) registered participants logged in to the live virtual meeting. The online engagement for each of the oral sessions ranged from 53 to 66%. There were 102 and 57 responders to the online pre- and post-meeting surveys, respectively. The majority of pre-meeting responders indicated a significant level of employer support to attend the virtual meeting. Post-meeting satisfaction exceeded pre-meeting expectations (‚Äòvery much‚Äô and ‚Äòquite a bit‚Äô; 86% vs. 54%; P < 0.0001). The majority indicated they would be ‚Äòquite a bit‚Äô or ‚Äòvery much‚Äô interested in future live virtual meetings. Conclusion: The TROG 2020 ASM was conducted as a live virtual meeting. Participant satisfaction and future interest in a live virtual meeting was high, indicating this is a viable platform for other CCTG‚Äôs faced with the decision to deliver virtual content at times of global public health threats.
