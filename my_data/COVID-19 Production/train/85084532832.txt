Data synthesis: COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage. Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin‚Äìangiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia, stress response, and so on; all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, and maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis.
