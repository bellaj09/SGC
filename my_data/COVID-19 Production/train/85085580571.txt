the big unknown: the asymptomatic spread of covid-19. ¬© 2020 Anguelov at al.The paper draws attention to the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases of COVID-19, which, according to some reports, may constitute a large fraction of the infected individu-als. These cases are often unreported and are not captured in the total number of confirmed cases communicated daily. On the one hand, this group may play a significant role in the spread of the infection, as asymptomatic cases are seldom detected and quarantined. On the other hand, it may play a significant role in disease extinction by contributing to the development of sufficient herd immunity.
