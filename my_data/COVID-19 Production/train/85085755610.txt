insouciance and inexperience: a deadly combination when dealing with covid-19. ¬© 2020 The Authors. International Journal of Health Planning and Management published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.This article gives key reasons for the UK's tardy and confused attempts to react to the COVID-19 pandemic. It explains very poor outcomes in the UK (in terms of the spread of the virus and high mortality, already striking at the time of writing), in terms of an initial lack of political will to prioritise public health, itself a product of a strong Prime Minister who made the ‚Äúwrong call‚Äù. It also highlights a failure to ‚Äúfollow the science‚Äù, except in so far as the ‚Äúscience‚Äù had already accepted some dubious political judgements and the lack of capacity to test as the starting-point.
