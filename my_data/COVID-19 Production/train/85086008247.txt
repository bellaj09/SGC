covid-19 serosurveillance may facilitate return-to-work decisions. Copyright ¬© 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and HygienePublic health measures are needed to resolve the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, although a looming economic fallout merits close attention. Early safe reintroduction of immune individuals into the workforce may be essential to protecting the economic welfare of communities. Reverse transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase chain reaction testing, our primary diagnostic tool to date, has sensitivity and timing concerns, owing to sampling/handling errors, as well as a complex virus‚Äìhost interaction. Reverse transcriptase‚Äìpolymerase chain reaction assays do not establish immune status once the virus has been cleared. Targeted serosurveillance for the determination of individuals‚Äô potential for transmissibility, particularly if paired with direct pathogen testing, may aid in ‚Äúcleared for business‚Äù decision-making.
