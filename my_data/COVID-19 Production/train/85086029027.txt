factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in adults with covid-19 outside of wuhan, china: a retrospective cohort study. ¬© 2020 The Author(s)Objectives: To investigate factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19, outside of Wuhan. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcome were retrieved. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore potential factors. Results: Overall, 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset until the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12‚Äì21). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190‚àí22.726; p = 0.028), time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296‚àí2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262‚àí2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: This study, with a relatively large sample size, focused on the duration of viral shedding and related factors in patients with COVID-19, outside of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantining infected patients.
