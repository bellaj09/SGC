advanced head and neck surgery training during the covid-19 pandemic. ¬© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted medical training. Here we assess its effect on head and neck surgical education. Methods: Surveys were sent to current accredited program directors and trainees to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the fellow's experience and employment search. Current fellows' operative logs were compared with those of the 2018 to 2019 graduates. Results: Despite reduction in operative volume, 82% of current American Head and Neck Society fellows have reached the number of major surgical operations to support certification. When surveyed, 86% of program directors deemed their fellow ready to enter practice. The majority of fellows felt prepared to practice ablative (96%), and microvascular surgery (73%), and 57% have secured employment to follow graduation. Five (10%) had a pending job position put on hold due to the pandemic. Conclusions: Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, current accredited trainees remain well-positioned to obtain proficiency and enter the work-force.
