impact of the covid-19 pandemic on patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders attending secondary care. ¬© College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2020.Objectives:To examine the psychological and social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on patients with established anxiety disorders during a period of stringent mandated social restrictions.Methods:Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an ICD-10 diagnosis of an anxiety disorder to determine the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions on anxiety and mood symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life.Results:Twelve (40.0%) participants described COVID-19 restrictions as having a deleterious impact on their anxiety symptoms. Likert scale measurements noted that the greatest impact of COVID-19 related to social functioning (Mean = 4.5, SD = 2.9), with a modest deleterious effect on anxiety symptoms noted (Mean = 3.8, SD = 2.9). Clinician rated data noted that 8 (26.7%) participants had disimproved and 14 (46.7%) participants had improved since their previous clinical review, prior to commencement of COVID-19 restrictions. Conditions associated with no 'trigger', such as generalised anxiety disorder, demonstrated a non-significant increase in anxiety symptoms compared to conditions with a 'trigger', such as obsessive compulsive disorder. Psychiatric or physical comorbidity did not substantially impact on symptomatology secondary to Covid-19 mandated restrictions.Conclusions:The psychological and social impact of COVID-19 restrictions on individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders has been modest with only minimal increases in symptomology or social impairment noted.
