exploring the rescue strategy for cardiac arrest in makeshift (fangcang) hospital workers during the pneumonia outbreak associated with covid-19. ¬© 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health. All rights reserved.Background: Beginning in Dec 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness termed COVID-19. The workers in the FangCang hospital have to work for more than 8 h and the work is high strength. Furthermore, to protect health and prevent serious cross-infection, they need to wear isolation equipment when working in FangCang hospital. These characteristics increase the risk of cardiac arrest (CA), which seriously endangers the lives of workers. Methods: We participated in the rescue of the patient and workers at first-line in FangCang hospital, and sum-marized the rescue strategies for workers rescuing. Results: Workers with CA were rescued in time according our guideline and showed zero dead in FangCang hospital. Conclusion: This study establishes the strategy for the CA of workers including the establishment of an in-FangCang resuscitation team, the establishment of a dedicated rescue room, and the formulation of rescue measures and procedures for CA of workers in the FangCang hospital. Therefore, we aimed to provide a strategy for the rescue of workers with CA in the FangCang hospital and share the success in rescuing with the world.
