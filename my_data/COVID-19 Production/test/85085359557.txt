south korea's covid-19 infection status: from the perspective of re-positive after viral clearance by negative testing. ¬© 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.COVID-19 started to occur in South Korea via inflow of the virus from abroad, when a case from Wuhan, China, was first confirmed on January 19th, 2020. Although South Korea has drastically reduced the number of new confirmed cases and is stabilizing the situation with its exemplary disease prevention policies, there remains a problem. These are cases which had shown negative results to PCR (gene amplification) tests as the COVID-19 virus had been removed but turned re-positive after a short period. The Central Clinical Committee analyzed that these re-positive cases after the COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the 'dead virus' remaining in the cured patients' body is amplified during the test process. Comprehending the above evidence, re-positive casescase of COVID-19 isare not infectious; the virus is not even reactivated. However, further research is required as we lack research results on this subject. Until we can be sure, social distancing and other such policies should be maintained.
