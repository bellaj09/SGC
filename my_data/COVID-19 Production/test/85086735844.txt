clinical evaluation of serological igg antibody response on the abbott architect for established sars-cov-2 infection. ¬© 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious DiseasesObjective: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Residual sera from 177 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and 163 non-COVID-19 patients were tested for antibody with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, USA). Clinical records for COVID-19 patients were reviewed to determine the time from onset of clinical illness to testing. Results: Specificity of the assay was 100.0% (95%CI: 97.1‚Äì100.0%). The clinical sensitivity of the assay varied depending on time from onset of symptoms, increasing with longer periods from the onset of clinical illness. The clinical sensitivity at ‚â§6 days was 8.6% (7/81; 95%CI: 3.8‚Äì17.5%), at 7‚Äì13 days 43.6% (17/39; 95%CI: 28.2‚Äì60.2%), at 14‚Äì20 days 84.0% (21/25; 95%CI: 63.1‚Äì94.7%), and at ‚â•21 days 84.4% (27/32; 95%CI: 66.5‚Äì94.1%). Clinical sensitivity was higher in the ‚â•14-day group compared to <14 days. There were no differences between the 14‚Äì20-day and ‚â•21-days groups; the combined clinical sensitivity for these groups (‚â•14 days) was 84.2% (49/57; 71.6‚Äì92.1%). Conclusion: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test has high specificity. Clinical sensitivity was limited in the early stages of disease but improved from 14 days after the onset of clinical symptoms.
