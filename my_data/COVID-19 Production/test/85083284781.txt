a 55-day-old female infant infected with 2019 novel coronavirus disease: presenting with pneumonia, liver injury, and heart damage. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.Background. Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations. Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants. Methods. We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness. Results. This case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes. Conclusions. When managing such infant patients with COVID-19, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is essential.
