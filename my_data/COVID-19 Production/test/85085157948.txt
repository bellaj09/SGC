sars-cov-2 identification in lungs, heart and kidney specimens by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. ¬© 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.From two COVID-19-related deaths, samples of lung, heart and kidney were collected and processed for Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy (TEM and SEM) with the aim of identifying the virus. Virions of SARS-CoV-2 were found in all tissues by TEM and SEM, corroborating the hypothesis that the virus enters the cells of different organs. This is the first report identifying SARS-CoV-2 in different human tissues by TEM and SEM.
