negligible risk of the covid-19 resurgence caused by work resuming in china (outside hubei): a statistical probability study. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

Risk assessment for such economic restoration is of significance. Here, we estimated the probability of COVID-19 resurgence caused by work resuming in typical provinces/cities and found that such probability is very limited (<5% for all the regions except Beijing). Our work may inform provincial governments to make risk level-based, differentiated control measures.
