This action research examines the status of the implementation of the ELearning classroom in selected HEI's in Region IV-A by conducting a qualitative approach using a survey questionnaire to a small group of professionals who have been teaching various courses in the tertiary level. This study utilized the descriptive method of research to bring out the current status of the implementation of the e-learning classroom in selected HEI's. An online survey data were collected and analyzed using the descriptive and documentary analysis. Findings indicate that the respondents had good experiences in introducing the E-learning classroom as an immediate response to the country's enhanced quarantine situation. Although all the E-learning platforms used by the respondents are free of charge, still, students have encountered problems like lack of resources, difficulty of Wi-Fi connection, and lack of training among the students and faculty members. this study recommends professional development workshops for both faculty members and students and preparation of advanced lessons, slide presentations, and examinations per unit to cope with the prescribed number of hours set by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). It is also expected that this action research would serve as a future guide for conducting an in-depth study using a structured interview to validate its findings.
