verification and diagnostic evaluation of the realstar¬Æ middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (n gene) reverse transcription-pcr kit 1.0. ¬© 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.Aim: We report the diagnostic evaluation of a confirmatory reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit targeting the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) N gene. Material & methods: 33 patient samples from two collections sites in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which were pre-characterized via real-time RT-PCR targeting MERS-CoV orf1a and upE, and were tested using the MERS-CoV N gene, as a confirmatory assay. This diagnostic procedure follows a two-step diagnostics scheme, recommended by the WHO. Results: 18/33 samples tested positive, 11/33 tested negative for MERS-CoV RNA and 2/33 showed uncertain results. Conclusion: The results suggest, that the RealStar¬Æ MERS-CoV (N gene) RT-PCR kit 1.0 can be considered a suitable and reliable confirmatory assay in combination with the RealStar MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0 according to the diagnostic scheme recommended by WHO.
