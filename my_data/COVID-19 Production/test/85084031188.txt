neurological complications of coronavirus and covid-19 complicaciones neurol√≥gicas por coronavirus y covid-19. ¬© 2020 Revista de Neurolog√≠aIntroduction. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system. Seven types of coronavirus can infect humans. Development. Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus). Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions. Future epidemiological studies and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.
