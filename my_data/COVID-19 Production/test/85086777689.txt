activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is associated with acute kidney injury in covid-19. Copyright ¬© 2020 Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise d'anesth√©sie et de r√©animation (Sfar). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.The pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is still poorly understood.
