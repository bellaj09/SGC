In this context, it is vital to ensure acute stroke care and optimize the care processes of the stroke code to reduce the risk of contagion and rationalize the use of hospital resources. To do this, the Ictus Madrid Multidisciplinary Group proposes a series of recommendations. Methods: Non-systematic bibliographic review of the available publications with the terms ¬´stroke¬ª and ¬´COVID-19¬ª or ¬´coronavirus¬ª or ¬´SARS-CoV-2¬ª, as well as other already known for the authors. We provide a document of recommendations as a result of the consensus of the Ictus Madrid Multidisciplinary Group and its Neurology Committee. Results: Our recommendations are structured on five lines: (1) coordinate to guarantee the access to hospital care for stroke patients, (2) recognize potentially COVID-19 infected stroke patients, (3) organize to ensure the protection of healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infections, (4) neuroimaging and other procedures potentially associated to risks for COVID-19 infection should be reduced and secured to avoid contagion, and (5) at home as soon as possible and supported follow-up to optimize hospital occupancy. The procedure is shown summarized under the acronym CORONA (COordinate, Recognize, Organize, Neuroimaging, At home). Conclusions: These recommendations can support the organization of healthcare services for acute stroke care and the optimization of their resources, guaranteeing the protection of healthcare professionals.
