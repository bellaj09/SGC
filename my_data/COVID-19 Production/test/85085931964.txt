perspectives on the relationship of renal disease and coronavirus disease 2019. ¬© 2020 The Author(s);.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic and its death toll is rocketing up. Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of developing COVID-19 complications and COVID-19 infection can also lead to renal dysfunction. Considering the importance of kidney function in COVID-19 patients, the present review is aimed to dig into the available evidence about kidney and COVID-19. We summarize the mechanisms underlying the renal injury in COVID-19 patients, and treatment strategies in dialysis and kidney transplant patients. We conclude, it is imperative to highlight the early monitoring of patients with AKI and carefully control kidney function during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
